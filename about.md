*Strange Animals Liking Strange Audio*, or *SALSA*, is a group of fuzzy, fuzzy-adjacent, and fuzzy-minded individuals and pluralities who really, **really** dig music.  It takes the form of a Telegram chat, but spins off side-projects such as this and a Dubtrack site.

This page exists sort of on a whim, but who knows, maybe it'll turn into some sort of music blog?
