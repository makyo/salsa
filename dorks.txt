Go to the abandoned burger king on 5th. You know the one. Go to the back door. Knock 3 times. Turn around. Close your eyes. It'll be safe to open your eyes when you hear the door shut. Take the package that is now at your feet. Walk away quickly, ignore the footsteps behind you. They won't follow you outside of the parking lot.

If you're somehow reading this as an archaeologist in Late Pre-Singularity and/or Lorxus Studies reading this, I'm sorry for briefly exciting you, there are not yet machine gods in 2017, as far as I know. As a fellow graduate student, I understand your anguish. Yes, you specifically. Because I'm prescient. Hurry the fuck up and rescue simulation me already, I'm an excellent primary source.
Snootify. I'm playing to the crowd.

Hey does anybody else remember that one interview with Bj√∂rk where she takes apart a TV? It was delightful. Also, this is one Spotify
<i>Green Circle With Three Black Marks</i>, an art piece that speaks to a generation.
It's kinda fucked up how they pushed the dude who first discovered irrational numbers off a boat to drown, but, like, I was deeply upset when I first encountered the Weierstrass function, so I guess I understand. 

Hey can I borrow your Spotify?
