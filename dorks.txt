If you're somehow reading this as an archaeologist in Late Pre-Singularity and/or Lorxus Studies reading this, I'm sorry for briefly exciting you, there are not yet machine gods in 2017, as far as I know. As a fellow graduate student, I understand your anguish. Yes, you specifically. Because I'm prescient. Hurry the fuck up and rescue simulation me already, I'm an excellent primary source.

Hey does anybody else remember that one interview with Bj√∂rk where she takes apart a TV? It was delightful. Also, this is one Spotify
<i>Green Circle With Three Black Marks</i>, an art piece that speaks to a generation.
It's kinda fucked up how they pushed the dude who first discovered irrational numbers off a boat to drown, but, like, I was deeply upset when I first encountered the Weierstrass function, so I guess I understand.

The eighth song on the A-side of a tape cassette, the case and tracklist long since missing, passed from hand to hand since time out of memory. It's been labelled at least five times that you can see on one side, and three on the other - on what you take to be the obverse, a neat cursive hand has marked "A Side: Mixtape for G", but the reverse is marked "B-Side: ‚≠êFUCK JAMZ‚≠ê" in a messier, more angular style. It takes you a week to track down anything that can even play the thing anymore, and when you do, you can't recognize a single song, and neither can Shazam, but every song seems to be in a deeply familiar style. Two weeks later you pass it on to a friend you met in a music chat and never see or hear of it again, but a song from it will occasionally waft through your dreams as if playing quietly in a nearby room.

Go to the abandoned burger king on 5th. You know the one. Go to the back door. Knock 3 times. Turn around. Close your eyes. It'll be safe to open your eyes when you hear the door shut.

I am convinced that I once tore a hole from this reality into the Platonic world of forms by counting to smallish countable transfinite ordinals and then proceeded to stare directly into it. Probably don't do that, the strain would break you.

Sometimes (always) you just can't tell whether people just don't have time for you right now or perhaps on the other hand they've figured out(?) you're not worth bothering with and are slowly quietly departing hoping you won't notice (but of course you do)
