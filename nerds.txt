Stravotify? Stravinskify? Spotinksy?
If you're somehow reading this as an archaeologist in Late Pre-Singularity and/or Lorxus Studies reading this, I'm sorry for briefly exciting you, there are not yet machine gods in 2017, as far as I know. As a fellow graduate student, I understand your anguish. Yes, you specifically. Because I'm prescient. Hurry the fuck up and rescue simulation me already, I'm an excellent primary source.

Go to the abandoned burger king on 5th. You know the one. Go to the back door. Knock 3 times. Turn around. Close your eyes. It'll be safe to open your eyes when you hear the door shut. Take the package that is now at your feet. Walk away quickly, ignore the footsteps behind you. They won't follow you outside of the parking lot.
