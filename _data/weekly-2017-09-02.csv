Makyo,XTC - Complicated Game,"This showed up on my Weekly, and I jumped to it before a few of the other songs because I'd recognized the name from the TMBG track XTC vs. Adam Ant. I wasn't really prepared, though, both for the sound of the piece and how much I liked it. The vocals a rough in a sort of David Byrne direction, then head somewhere else in turn at the singer's warbling of 'game'. What really got me, though was the tail end of the song, built up from the vocals being run through a delay, so that the singers sounds as though he's performing [katajjaq](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ir6S49-Fc), [Inuit throat singing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inuit_throat_singing), with himself.",Compli- (compli-) cated (cated) compli- (compli-) cated (cated),https://open.spotify.com/track/3LKfHbhF3HAyWA2IcoE1lP
Amdusias,Pryapisme - Totipotence D'un Erg,"This song puts me into a rare state: I don't actually know what genre this is, at all, and I don't even really know how I'd describe it.

It's really, really good though! It's part prog rock, part breakcore, part jazzy piano solo. Also it's the end of a concept album about a Satanic cat ritual, so there are cat meows? I don't make the rules, man, I just really liked this whole album.",Cool Spot,https://open.spotify.com/track/4B5CfLNq35dzlmXYXQEUNL
Lorxus,Magnus Palsson - Pressure Cooker,"It's a really fun crunchy chiptune song! I don't get to talk much about those, or about video game soundtracks, which I usually don't like much in their own right. VVVVVV is the exception.","Probably just Youtube, actually, not sure if Spotify has this one, or just PLAY VVVVVV for heck's sake, it's good",https://open.spotify.com/track/4t7Y6dFwMTatAR5mKMSshs
Alteq,LCD Soundstyem - You Can't Hide / Shame on You,"With the release of the new album, I was reminded of the live version of this part of 45:33. I've always been in love with this track; the baseline, the mood, it's just got a groove I can't get enough of. The Reggie Watts solo at the end is what brings it all together for me.",Mmm that hits the Spotify,https://open.spotify.com/track/6HhFgEBHu25b8gy8Bl4eG0
Proxy,Brockhampton - JUNKY,"There's not much to say about Brockhampton that hasn't already been said in other outlets; between how explicitly queer one of the MCs is and the intense lyrical prowess and excellent production that's just as capable of turning heavy subjects into bangers, there's not much to really say other than to listen for yourself? JUNKY is one of the standouts on SATURATION II, having a heavy hard-hitting nature that you still want to bang out in a car as you hear lines about giving a masc dude head. It's great.",Spoooooootles,https://open.spotify.com/track/7ujucw8kFBPIy9mz7DlmAq
