Peri,Klimchak - Rain Wings,"I'm going to be honest, all week I've been listening to the Deltarune soundtrack. But that's not on Spotify yet, so instead, this: Klimchak (Who I had the joy of seeing live recently) describes himself as a ""percussionist"", but that doesn't really capture the broadness of what he's working with. When he performs, what you see is a man sitting at a desk covered in a mess of electronics. As he plays, he starts drawing miscellaneous instruments out of his case. Melodicas, recorders, circuit-bent toys, , tongue drums. You name it, he's got it. His music is constantly shifting, adding, removing, looping with these instruments. It's organized chaos, though, and in the end incredibly fun and flows wonderfully.",Yip Soft,https://open.spotify.com/track/5npRelXc03cVF6TTyGhR6G?si=w3rRl_LcQlaRaLJzdFlTJg
Makyo,Fiona Apple - Hot Knife,"Last weekend, Fiona Apple came up in SALSA, and I realized I hadn't listened to her basically since Extraordinary Machine came out waaay back in \*checks\* oh god. So I did some digging, and found the *The Idler Wheel Is Wiser Than The Driver of The Screw And Whipping Cords Will Serve You More Than Ropes Will Ever Do*, which is a hell of a Fiona Apple album title. There's quite a lot I like about this in comparison with her older works. It's far drier, and more focused on percussion, which is super cool. Something about this song in particular, though, grabbed my attention. It's super sparse with lots of tight vocal harmonies, which is always something I love, but it also has some of the most positive Fiona lyrics I've heard, and something about them is just really touching in that doe-eyed crush sort of way that I like so much (even if ""he's never gonna need another"" isn't really in my helplessly poly vocabulary).

Amdusias,Fox Capture Plan - Greatest Blue,"My conversation with my partner about this piece went something like this: ""Do you want to hear way too many...fivelets? Fivetuplets? Uh, 20th notes?"" ""Quintuplets?"" ""Right.""

So if you do, here you go! Cool-ass jazz. Way too many 20th notes. Right.",Fox Spotify Joke,https://open.spotify.com/track/76CkTGHrmdM791CxgeQqUO?si=WcCYhcpxQ-mDtCAJ71CVlg
Proxy,Haru Nemuri - narashite,"Haru Nemuri is a really intriguing artist! Sheâ€™s a rapper first and foremost, but draws a lot of inspiration from indie rock/underground rock scene as much as she has an ear for poppy melody. She also has a lot of post-hardcore tendencies, a compelling scream, and just a lot of charisma. This track is a good entry point for her, as she keeps the screaming to moments of highest impact.",Shipshpop,https://open.spotify.com/track/7IIRN7KZksXp9ieBFmNuHI
