Lorxus,(The Sound of Space-Filling Curves),"As a mathematician, algorithmically derived music and music generated with minimal processing from interesting mathematical structures have long intrigued me. Iolet, a soundtrack made for a book, has long counted itself among my favorite albums, and Adam Neely has done some neat things with recursive musical patterns making use of syncopation at high speed, but I found this gem more recently on Twitter. Perhaps it doesn't make for the most compelling music in its own right, but I find it fairly interesting as a glimpse of what else might be, as well as the latest entry in a proud, milennia-old tradition of doing weird stuff with math and music combined.",DON'T YOU GET IT? IT'S MUSIC ALL THE WAY DOWN AHAHAHAHAHAHA,http://www.win.tue.nl/~hermanh/doku.php?id=sound_of_space-filling_curves
Proxy,Speedy Ortiz - Fun,"Speedy Ortiz are a band that I really love, filled with a mixture of blunt lyricism and clever wordplay that augments its blunt messages and themes, elevating the material into puzzlebox status to elucidate the layers beyond just what's there on the surface. ""Fun"", off of their first record *Major Arcana*, is an example of this. It's arguably the most pop-grunge-y of the songs off of this record, with a major key and everything! But it also features lines that switch up the target of the song from someone using someone else to the target (the narrator) now being the one who is successful.

In utilizing its neat lyrical choices juxtaposed against one another (""Criminally twisted//Puny little villain//Exercised your claws and sprang from the aquarium"" & ""Military systems//The first one to dismiss 'em//Shot over the sea//You act just like you hardly know me"", for example), it shifts the focus to the success of the narrator rather stealthily. It's a lot to unpack with its mixture of blunt and symbolic language in just a two-minute song, and I love it to pieces. It's just fun.",Sportizify,https://open.spotify.com/track/4jci5zpDMj9v6BkMg8Yy5M
Makyo,Consider the Source - Closer to Home,"Something about those hooty guitars really gets to me. I couldn't remember this song for quite a while. All I could remember was the melody and ""it sounds like wild Ratatat"", which wasn't much to go on. It took a bit of digging through my Discover playlists to get there!",Spotiotiotiotiotify,https://open.spotify.com/track/753GCnF0XHHjZvr9cAtcsI?si=UzhkBXghTRC0D1Q2-9VXGg
Knacker,The Moody Blues - Legend of a Mind,"Ray Thomas passed away last week, so I've been listening to my favorite Mood Blues songs that feature him. This song was his tribute to psychadelic pioneer Timothy Leary. The jaunty second section features Thomas' warm voice as uncannily clear as if he were singing right in front of you, while his flute solo in the third section is both haunting and energetic. Mike Pinder's mellotron as always brings in the other-worldly orchestra. The song is a miniature epic within the grand sonic adventure that is In Serach of the Lost Chord.",Spiong.,https://open.spotify.com/track/7Gzlsdq3UscVRqRn7x7avR
