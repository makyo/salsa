Makyo,Haken - The Cockroach King,"So, I heard this song a while back and immediately strated a new playlist with it called [TENORS YELLING](https://open.spotify.com/user/drabmakyo/playlist/2AxVD9fKT8lqIv9vcE90iV?si=Y9-IXWQ9R6uUYaxkDakPEw) because, well...that's sorta what happens here. For some reason, I just really latched onto this song, though. It's so damn dramatic, and so damn catchy. And they sound like Muppets. And they [*totally own that*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_e4YX73Ww4).",Muppetify,https://open.spotify.com/track/0J1CIpL8IuUf0OyijwkMFj?si=kNvVp_VLSyW7zDaSqqb56g
Proxy,"Now, Now - MJ","Now, Now is a band I've been following for a few years now. Their 2012 record *Threads* was an excellent slice of poppy emo-tinged indie rock with a strong ear for hooks and whispery vocals (helps that it's also pretty explicitly queer!). They remained silent for a few years only to come back with singles last summer and earlier this year announcing a new album, *Saved*. That finally came out last week and it's a major shift in sound: the band is embracing a slicker, synthier pop soundscape while remaining true to its emo roots.

""MJ"" is one of my favourites off of this new record. Lead vocalist KC is singing to Michael Jackson -- her childhood idol -- about a deteriorating relationship, using him as a connecting point to this girl she had a connection with. The lyrics pinpoint the frustration with the dissolution of the relationship rather than the specifics, but it works in the song's favour as setup for later in the album. ""MJ"" is also extremely catchy, its whispered harmonies in its chorus and driving synths giving this dancey momentum. A catchy chorus and momentum that let you lose yourself in the vibe of it all while having lyrical content that grounds it is a sign of a good pop tune in my mind.","Spot, ify",https://open.spotify.com/track/5j9xOabBmfilEU0K2TUh2y?si=tF2khtr8Q5Oc7c-1ckbq3Q
