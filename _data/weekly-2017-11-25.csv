Alteq,The Decemberists - On The Bus Mall,"It took me a while to get into The Decemberists, but they opened the door to a lot of folk-type music for me late in my college years. This track in particular I enjoy, because of it's fantastic descriptive langauge, and warming tone, despite the drearyness of its landscape. It's a little treasure for me; I love singing it, and hope to learn the guitar for it someday.",Spiffem's,https://open.spotify.com/track/6jnK88ewnX2ujehb8ApoeW
Lu,BATHS - Broadback,"Last week, Proxy put ""Adam Copies"" on the Weekly. I'm here to keep the BATHS streak going, because for the past two weeks this has been basically the only album I've been listening to. And while I could talk about any song, I want to bring ""Broadback"" u p for a very specific reason.

Queer stories in fantasy is harder to find than it should be, especially in 2017. Fantasy, as a genre, is allowed to do whatever the fuck it wants to do, and so it always defaulting to cis and het is both a problem and a symptom of bigger problems with society's ideals of what is considered normal. When we create worlds, we should be able to make up a new normal, but it doesn't happen nearly as much as it could.

""Broadback"" is just one song on an album full of great queer music, and arguably ""Yeoman"" treads an even more inviting queer space of a Verne-like science fantasy world. But what ""Broadback"" does is allow queer romance to be about more than just falling in love. Our narrator is just trying to convince a fighter-type in a fantasy world to not fight, even though he knows he will, because losing him would ruin him. It's not ""it would ruin me because we can't be queer in this world"", but just merely because the narrator loves Broadback.

And that's so refreshing. It's not queer martyr syndrome. It's not gay as metaphor. It is simply ""I don't want to lose you, and I cannot carry you back if you get hurt"". It is love, that is just also queer, and I don't want it to die.",Spotify Copies,https://open.spotify.com/track/4z1FYz1yoezQVSTdTqph7n
Proxy,Bjork - Arisen My Senses,"Can I just put all of 'Utopia' on here?

This track is such a killer opener to a beautiful, healing album. It's especially important to follow up with this if you dug 'Vulnicura', as it completes the emotional throughway. That emphasis on the leading tone, that skittering yet spacious production with so much brightness...this is gorgeous.",Spotify er ekki í boði í þínu landi,https://open.spotify.com/track/5DoSDqhMe4Zi0dLVayOewW
Amdusias,Soulwax- Masterplanned,"This was a week of catching up on music for me, so I actually have a ton of reasonable choices for this spot. So let's just pick one I've been pretty into lately.

I went into this album knowing two things about Soulwax: they've done several remixes that I really really like, and that they currently had [the longest album title ever](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Most_of_the_Remixes) until Chumbawumba (yes, that Chumbawumba) replaced them.

Right, so, uh, this track! It's a jam. That bass feels like it wants to crumble and slip through my fingers. I love the panning techniques in the intro bit. Wow!","

Lorxus,Foxhole - A Children's Canto,"Spotify discover is a hell of a treasure, isn't it? I dunno, I think about machine learning and deliberate overfitting a lot - the accidental gaps in musical taste, the spaces in between songs, the seldom-visited vectors in the span of the basis given by your desires. The Wintering Tree is such an album. Such things feel more like archaeology, sometimes, than research.","Heh heh, Foxhole",https://open.spotify.com/track/5jVlhsoyvFWbSBeuFjr22r
