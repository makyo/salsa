Peri,The Soundtrack Show,"David W. Collins is a sound designer from the Lucasfilm days who shows his endless love for film music in the form of a good good podcast. Every episode he dissects famous film scores, taking them apart from their basic composition, examing them in historical context, and discussing the roles the music plays in the film. I love how he manages to get us into film composers heads and figure out how they were thinking when they were writing famous film scores, and which influences they were leaning on. I've always been a big fan of composers like John Williams/Jerry Goldsmith/Jack Horner/Etc. and he manages to deepen my appreciation for them. So far he's focused primarily on John Williams scores (An understandable bias), but he's slowly but surely adding in more composers.",Spotificial (Or other Podcast source of your choice),https://open.spotify.com/episode/1fNvSUIViChx58gWSpZLls?si=zg6BeAd3Q5WPeWqDb1dKQQ
Amdusias,God Is An Astronaut- Seance Room,"I'm fairly into post-rock, which probably won't surprise anyone who has actually talked to me for too much time. For whatever reason, I'd been out of the loop on a lot of this year's releases until about a week or so ago, in which I binge-listened to every decently-rated album in the course of about a week. It was...a lot of post-rock.

In any case, *Seance Room* was a standout track, full of everything that I love about the genre: great dynamic range, great shifts in tone, and a good overall space to completely lose oneself in.",Funny Spotify Pun,https://open.spotify.com/track/1b36UGMCweUQeoz1Z4ESJS?si=46lUfbrhRuOyUHkQhFzczQ
Makyo,Easily Embarrassed - And to Start With,"I got to thinking about [good psytrance album openers](https://open.spotify.com/user/drabmakyo/playlist/6x4Bs9QR5zhPADvdR1366T?si=CxJ1o6uYQIWiF7E0Ji3hBg), because there are quite a few (psytrance being pretty good about cohesive albums), and basically flipped a coin on that playlist and came up with this one. I found psytrance in high school through Shpongle and basically wore out my copies of Are You Shpongled? and Tales of the Inexpressible, the jewel-cases slowly disintegrating over time. It took until 2013 that I did any further exploration, though, when Shpongle's Museum of Consciousness (Brain in a Fish Tank being a bit too self-aware to make the playlist, in my opinion) came out that I did any further digging, stumbling across Younger Brother's Vaccine and, later, Ott's Fairchildren. Finally, EE4C showed up on a Discover Weekly for me, and I've been digging Easily Embarrassed since.",Shroomify,https://open.spotify.com/track/2eal765k4DChnFvLd6IhGA?si=T5VDy7jRTh2BCM43zHAR9w
Peri,Nine Inch Nails - Closer,"This week I found out that one of my partners had never really listened to Nine Inch nails. Since Trent Reznor's music formed such an important part of my identity and aesthetics in the 90s and early 2000s, I felt obligated to make an introduction. While Closer isn't my favorite NIN song, it's great, still feels aggressively present, and has an [amazing music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTFwQP86BRs) to boot. Pull out your black shirts, leather dusters, and polished Docs and enjoy thinking back to when goths got radio play and alternative meant absolutely nothing because somehow this is the same genre as the Presidents of the United States of America according to the Geniuses Of 90s Music Radio.",Gothify,https://open.spotify.com/track/39tLc4Xp58Lu4KcWHggeE2?si=UKLMtGoPRXep7YHPvfxGGw
Lu,Robyn - Missing U,"Honestly, Robyn is the most mature pop star out there right now and she doesn't get as much credit for it as she should. After having a pretty normal arc of a teen pop star, giving us ""Show Me Love"" and disappearing, Robyn decided it was better to just make art pop that she wanted to make. So instead of a series of albums groping for relevancy, Robyn jumped a decade ahead and started making the music that we would all be chasing after instead.

""Missing U"" follows in the tradition of ""Call Your Girlfriend"" and ""Dancing on My Own""; these songs are about specific, empathetic emotions. Robyn is very good about not going for the easier emotions, which is why she always feels like an adult making this music. ""Call Your Girlfriend"" sat so nicely with me due in large part to its sympathetic tone. Your old relationship is over, but that's no reason to be an asshole--that's a great message for a breakup song. It's different, for one, and more than that, it urges being kind. And who doesn't want more kindness? ""Dancing on My Own"" tapped into the anxiety of seeing an ex out in public after a breakup happens, and instead of making a scene, just having to live in your feelings quietly, on the sidelines. It's a song about realizing you're not the lead character in that person's story anymore.

On ""Missing U"", Robyn gives us an intentionally vaguely-directed but sharply-worded lament for loss. Whether this is a loss of a relationship, or of a platonic loved one; whether it is from death, moving, or a falling out, it's not clear. ""Missing U"" instead gets at something deeper, the little bits of detritus that hang around after someone is gone. Nothing says this more than the bridge's lyrics: ""This part of you, this clock that's stopped. This residue, it's all I've got"". That's a kind of emotional maturity and nuance that a lot of other pop songs never reach. Robyn reaches for so much more, all the time. And god do I love it.",Splort,https://open.spotify.com/track/4Sn5B44sLfQ364FUL98jvN?si=7hwsGCYERR6ko6zOCxfYcA
Din Fleetpaw,KORPIKLAANI - A Man With A Plan,I always forget this song till it comes up 2nd or 3rd in my relax playlist. It's one of those power metal songs that's good to just zone out to and feel good about. Also the music video was some folk's final project for their schooling so support that shit!,BooDoobs,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bc0sJvtKrRM
