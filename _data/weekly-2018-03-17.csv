Proxy,Leikeli47 - Miss Me,"No huge writeup this week, just vibing with the sentiment real hard. This track has a more old-school New York rap approach to its beat and flow, and there's some fun wordplay on display here. Also, Leikeli47 is underappreciated as an MC.",BLUNT LOADED LIKE A FULL CLIP,https://open.spotify.com/track/1p83y5KHwv3Ri4W5xfbiz9
Amdusias,Camp Cope- How To Socialize & Make Friends,"Camp Cope was the opener on the last Against Me! tour, and the similarity shows; the first track on this album (the aptly-named ""The Opener"") is a straight-up diss track of all of the obnoxious men in their lives. I'm into it.

Track two, meanwhile, is a fuck-off breakup song about an apparently very creepy person:

Yeah I guess we both got our problems and areas to improve
And I know one of mine is to go a night without sympathising with you
I can see myself living without you and being fine
For the rest of my life

All I know is: I really don't want to be the person this song is about.",How To Spotify & Make Friends,https://open.spotify.com/track/6MLOrfxW94nciqFOzlua47?si=do4CV2MQRk2LVfDJborpRw
Peri,BomBARDed - A Musical Dungeons and Dragons Adventure,"So my weekly rec is a bit of a weird one. It's a Dungeons and Dragons liveplay podcast (All the rage, these days) with a twist. All the players are actual musicians (Members of the band Lindby) who all play Bards (Magical musicians who perform to make spells) and they have to play their Bardic tunes in real life. There's great chemistry within the group, plenty of musical jokes and horrible puns, and the existence of ""Chord Dice"" that the players have to roll to generate songs. Good fun.",Spots & Ify's,https://open.spotify.com/episode/7N1S56lYzpEZY12Fcly3zo?si=c-RMG4P0RpOh-oUZlAz_UA
Lunostophiles,"Inital Talk, Dua Lipa - New Rules [Initial Talk Remix]","80s remixes are a <i>thing</i>. My first exposure to this seemingly YouTube-specific subgenre of remix came from TRONICBOX, who has done some amazing work in their own right. But none of the remixes have caught themselves so harshly in my brain as this remix of ""New Rules"". What Initial Talk does in recontextualizing the song is nothing short of genius, entirely rewriting the mood and intensity of the song. While it still comes across as a post-breakup 'get my house in order' song, the ferocity of the 80s synth pads takes this from melancholy dance tune to a fervent expression of kicking shitty lovers to the curb.

And honestly, the video that was made for it is worth your attention, too. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLjNTTCVat0","Spotify, but 80s",https://open.spotify.com/track/2ygfHXyt3gvyhvKrNJU61n?si=dUmlmzzWRvinKJYSZYwUAA

Lorxus,Outkast - Hey Ya,"Did you know that this entire song is in 11/4? Because it is! I always wondered why I liked this song alone out of all the dreck I had to listen to in middle school, and now I know.","SHAKE IT, SHAKE SHAKE IT, SHAKE IT, SHAKE SHAKE IT, SHAKE IT LIKE A POLAROID SPOOTY, HEY YA",https://open.spotify.com/track/2PpruBYCo4H7WOBJ7Q2EwM

Amari,Adam Betts - Drumbones,"Just found out this dude is playing in London in the summer and I got the urge to listen to his debut EP again.

Makyo,Henry Homesweet - Flex Out,"Henry Homesweet is one of those artists that will always mean a lot to me, and, though I put little stock into the classical idea of having 'our song', this would likely be one for me and Amdusias. The lyrics may just be 'flop, shop' repeated throughout, which is kinda silly, but it's just a spectacularly bouncy and catchy chip/house song all around, so the lyrics don't need to be super deep.",Sbeepbeepbeep,https://open.spotify.com/track/61oRbeGA7NWlCgemLjZ9wc
