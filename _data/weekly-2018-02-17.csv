Makyo,Milo - Landscaping,"This album is...almost over the top in its references. Nobakov, Godspeed You! Black Emperor, The Rite of Spring, words like 'jejune' and 'ennui' tossed out like they're nothing. It's a wonderful example of how tight rhymes can be without being just *fast*. This album, [Who told you to think??!!??!!?!?!?!](https://open.spotify.com/album/4Gp0hjbEreTxanivZ5N62V) wound up on a playlist of conscious hip-hop, as Amdusias put it, along with [Splendor and Misery](https://open.spotify.com/album/5eC0cRYhgBcaiDhJerBcT3), [In Celebration of Us](https://open.spotify.com/album/7bvGhkFkhBksTpL7eI5t9q), and [Apologies in Advance](https://open.spotify.com/album/2tvSJNXlpJNnkcGDhMVZmO). I've really been digging the genre recently. [Take advantage of the naysayer](https://open.spotify.com/track/5qrIuDleceDFM5ry2Orp08) was my follow-up choice, because I'm a sucker for songs that have little hitches of silence in them!","I love wild things wildly, I love quiet things quietly, I love spotty things spotify...",https://open.spotify.com/track/3YksfUsTRU8BrU5f0BS286
Amdusias,Sylvan LaCue- Empathy,"""Ammy, I'm really surprised that you got so into this concept album about a support group for emotions, and a group of people striving for more earnestness!""

Well, you probably shouldn't have been, but here it is: *Apologies in Advance* is my favorite album of 2018 so far, at least in part because it's just...me, but if I could rap really well. Here we have someone writing a song with multiple tough admissions: ""sometimes I mistake being able to help someone with a problem for an emotional connection"" and ""I feel incapable of shutting the world out for long enough to finish something important to me"" aren't exactly common hip-hop lyrical tropes, but here they both are, in the same song, even! I absolutely cannot recommend this whole album highly enough at this point.

Also I promise Makyo and I didn't plan this, but her song's great too!",The Twelve Spot Program,https://open.spotify.com/track/5BtwQfYsoIGOrH3GaJZoyn?si=mgQF5ntdQR-HwN2Pv8ZWKg
Lorxus,David Bergeaud - Scaling the Cliffs,"I've previously mentioned [my enjoyment of VVVVVV's soundtrack](/2017/09/02/salsa-weekly/), but the extent to which the soundtrack of perhaps the first or second game I ever played - Ratchet and Clank - completely slipped my mind until Mando reminded me of its existence when they mentioned that the soundtrack had been replaced by something decidedly more lackluster in the remaster. I went back and gave the original a listen and fell in love with it, awash in Proustian recall, all over again. I've linked up my favorite from the game - ""Scaling the Cliffs"", from Eudora, which combines clarinets, glitchy button noises, and a healthy dose of funk. Give it a listen!","It's kind of a shame that thanks to The Election I'm not on speaking terms with the once-beloved uncle whose apartment I played Ratchet and Clank at for the first time, but memory is forever.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDEqVyPUGBY&list=PLEC644E72887AB7E3
Proxy,Hop Along - How Simple,"""How Simple"" is a catchy breakup song that's pensive and weaves more nuance into even just short moments. This still feels mature, ending a relationship not with melodrama but with reassurance that life will go on even without each other. That combined with a catchy chorus with backup singers and a violin outro help this stand out as just a solid indie rock hit. I wasn't familiar with Hop Along before listening to this, but upon listening to their 2015 record *Painted Shut* right afterward, this lead single has me pumped for their next record.",Spot Along,https://open.spotify.com/track/25TEJRIxhKm5XEBCVUpe6r
