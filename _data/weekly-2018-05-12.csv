Proxy,Baths - Superstructure,"I've been revisiting *Romaplasm* recently, which I've talked about at length on SALSA before. Lu has also covered the intense ""Human Bog"", which might be one of the most intensely/depressingly relatable songs about queerness I've ever heard. For today, let's turn our focus to another excellent song: ""Superstructure"".

The songwriting here is intentionally more vague than a lot of the album, and getting the full context of it requires listening to it as a whole. The last two lines of each repetition of the chorus help ground the listener in the point: ""I let the fulcrum buckle underneath//Deny my inhibitions and find modernity"". A lot of the record is about escapism from a cruel world that forces queer folks to hide who they truly are, to deny themselves the future they desire for the sake of the future they can have. This song firmly pinpoints that as the reasoning for previous escapism in other songs (such as ""Yeoman"").

Package this heavy point in a tune that's constantly driving, layering its vocals in ways that emphasize Wiesenfeld's lower range after contrasting with his signature falsetto. The synths feel mechanical in a way that emphasizes the technological elements of the lyrics and drives the human elements into focus.

Amdusias,Thank You Scientist- Psychopomp,"Things we know:

- ""psychopomp"" is a super cool word.
- TYS is really quickly becoming one of my favorite prog bands; the horns add so much to their arrangements, and there are so many more ways to play noodly 32nd notes in 19/32 or whatever.
- This song is basically everything I want out of ridiculous prog songs: it's in about 35 different time signatures, there's a totally out of place sample of a doctor talking about philosophy, part of it is in harmonic minor for no discernable reason, and there are multiple meedly Buckethead solos; despite all this, it somehow doesn't overstay its welcome at all, and I've been listening to it multiple times a day since I heard it a couple of weeks ago.",You separate the physical from the Spotify,https://open.spotify.com/track/6XKGXM1Mbe8e0nr0eDCuif?si=s-YYPviISSGWo-gewfUXXw
