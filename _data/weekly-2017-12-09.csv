Knacker,"Michael Geyre, Shinichi Sakamoto - Monster-Town","From soundtrack of Wonder Boy: The Dragon's Trap. It's a new remake of Wonder Boy III from 1987.
I haven't played the game, but the new graphics are gorgeous. The track arrangements likewise are bright, cheery, and toe-tapping and played on an eclectic array of live instruments.
The mandolin on this particular track just sounds so joyous and inviting, and makes me want to move to Monster-Town and live there the rest of my life.",Bandcamp only right now,https://dotemu.bandcamp.com/track/monster-town
Lu,"Marvin Gaye, Studio Rio - Sexual Healing","This is just an amazing remix of an already amazing song. It keeps all the swagger and style but lightens it up, gives it some sun and some sea spray. This is the exact song I would want to hear while entering an outdoor jazz lounge Ipanema. And then four hours of bossa nova.","[A LONG, SLOW MOAN FROM THE UNIVERSE]",https://open.spotify.com/track/16aVOG9YBesM18yE4ReEHo
Peri,Diablo Swing Orchestra - Lady Clandestine Chainbreaker,What do you mean you haven't listened to Pacifisticuffs yet? Good God! Listen to it! I had a hard time picking a song to link from this album. DSO stuffs so much variety and talent into each album. I decided on this one because I dig those jazzy Latin riffs intermixed with soaring proggy sections. Close second was definitely Disco Metal Jigsaw Hustle and an honorable mention for Interruptions pop ballad metal.,Spoofity,https://open.spotify.com/track/2aMBVUIe8GHcyFXyFG9txt?si=rE_WUFPzSHOQ_4nWKQNtmg
Amdusias,Phoebe Bridgers- Funeral,"2017 has turned into the year of ""albums that I adore that I never ever want to listen to again"", and Phoebe Bridgers' *Stranger in the Alps* is no exception: this album is a gut punch or three, as you might expect from a track called ""Funeral.""

It's about a friend who died of a drug overdose, and it shows. But it's also *achingly* beautiful and cathartic, and if you're a fan of earnest singer-songwriter material in any way whatsoever, you owe it to yourself to check this out.",A slightly more depressing version of Spotify,https://open.spotify.com/track/2Tbym0L4Xlox9nol0YzPct

Lorxus,They Move On Tracks of Neverending Light,Soundtrack for a wistful lonely Friday night at a con.,Sometimes (always) you just can't tell whether people just don't have time for you right now or perhaps on the other hand they've figured out(?) you're not worth bothering with and are slowly quietly departing hoping you won't notice (but of course you do),https://open.spotify.com/track/3cIG78oBauowzEbkBwWADN
Makyo,Caspian - Sycamore,"So I picked two postrock songs this go 'round. This first one is by Caspian, who was the fourth post-rock band I found (after Godspeed You! Black Emperor, Explosions in the Sky, and Inspirative). They're more...laid back? They like if EitS got a bit less hopeful, or if Inspirative got a bit more cello. Despite being more laid back than GY!BE, they're more melodically active.

Anyway, I picked both of my songs due to their drums. This one ends on just a fantastically positive note, despite there being only drums. It's hard to place just why that active, almost clapping drumline manages to convey a very specific upbeat sense. It's almost like dancing around the fire in a drum circle, those without drums clapping joyously. Nothing happens in isolation, of course, so maybe the nuance is in all of the work it takes to *get* to the final drum section.",Implacable toms,https://open.spotify.com/track/46bZrlKnQVf7Ph8nBH80rF
Amdusias,Archspire- Involuntary DoppelgÃ¤nger,"In perhaps the wildest tonal shift I've pulled in one of these posts this year, let's go from that last track to Archspire.

My journey with this band after hearing about them goes something like this: ""everyone in this band is a ridiculously good musician"" > ""I'm not quite sure that the stuff the drummer is doing obeys all known laws of physics"" > *finding out that they're playing about half an hour from where I live*, and, yeah, they're actually that absurd live too.

A comment on a blog about their latest album called them ""the band that no one has the stones to cover"", which is pretty fair; the whole of *Relentless Mutation* is at a level of musicianship I haven't heard in a metal album in a long time.","A much, much louder version of Spotify",https://open.spotify.com/track/4K1yqd68vWmDXFwXAqW35d
Alteq,Majical Cloudz - Turns Turns Turns,Majical Cloudz has a simplicity to their music that I've become enamored with.,Spootnik,https://open.spotify.com/track/4VgyyXEj9pVGM8VfNVnf3Y
Lu,Sufjan Stevens - Tonya Harding (In D major),"The amount of times I have listened to both this song and its Eb sibling is staggering, considering that there are only twenty four hours in a day. I could, in fact, invent a whole new hour and call it Hour 100, that is how many times I've listened to this song in a finite amount of time.

In seriousness, there is something mystical about this track. To write anything about Tonya Harding is to interact with a Gordian knot of scandal and lifestyle so girthy that no Alexandrian sword would ever get through it. It is a story, told so many times, in so many movies and real lives, of how a certain brand of fame can take someone from mountain to valley in an eyelash flutter. Beneath its dreamy, sleepy surface, ""Tonya Harding"" acts as a living eulogy for someone caught in the jaws of a bigger beast than she. Harding is no martyr nor victim, but merely a thing we study. Sufjan Stevens is, perhaps, <i>a tad</i> wistful for this story, but that adds to its realness. Being no stranger to complicated feelings, Stevens here indulges in his love of broken things.

Complicated people leave complicated stories. Tonya Harding is more than a victim and soldier for the rage of fame, and ""Tonya Harding"" is more than a soft melodrama to a fallen star. There's something spiky, but comforting in stories about people failing themselves. And here, we get to experience it with a little more tenderness. No less scorn, but a little more softness.",[PLAYS ALL OF CARRIE & LOWELL WHILE SOBBING SOFTLY BEHIND A HALF-BARE CHRISTMAS TREE],https://open.spotify.com/track/5flC7ecW5rQd5miVSFZqWk
Proxy,The Body & Full Of Hell - Earth Is A Cage,"2017 is a year full of harsh releases and this is definitively one of them. Doom outlet The Body and grindcore band Full Of Hell teamed up for a second collab album this year entitled *Ascending a Mountain of Heavy Light*, and if either one of those genres entices you then you will enjoy this collab. It is as relentless in its abraision as it is at setting an atmosphere and melding its two styles fluidly via production tricks.

This song is an encapsulation of the perfect melding of these two bands, bringing out the buzzing machine-gun pace of Full of Hell's grindcore drumming and strumming patterns, intersplicing hard-to-interpret vocals with screams and decent amounts of space in between these sections of clipped percussion pummelling. It also manages to have this really solid melodic base that comes through even through the mixture of blipping vocal production. The mixing work here is extremely solid all-around, actually, with the electronics blending and merging seamlessly in with the grindcore elements. The only real doom-influenced bits are during the aforementioned quiet portions which make the louder bits stand out that much more but also, as previously-mentioned have the most production trickery in all of the song. 

It's compelling to dissect as you listen but also is perfect for smashing glass with a baseball bat.","the unrelenting jackhammer outside your window, reminding you every morning that maybe you should move soon",https://open.spotify.com/track/5KahFcA0cSDvVr1UV7tNEF
Makyo,This Will Destroy You - Little Smoke,"My second postrock song is much, much harder, and way less upbeat. This Will Destroy You is...sorta like postmetal, maybe? This one starts out calm with a stage rhodes and some string synths, followed by some guitars in that lingering, postrocky way, then goes all crunchy-grindy-screamy. Rather than having those implacable dancy clappy toms, this one comes with a super slow snare hit that drives it forward. Way more doomy than the Caspian song. 

As with both, the songs are awesome, but the albums as a whole are fantastic, and well worth a full listen-through. Some of it reminds me of [bits from the There Will Be Blood soundtrack](https://open.spotify.com/track/5gHu56UXELp87jYIpauO75).",Implacable snare drums,https://open.spotify.com/track/5PRT20IK6C92SmLDbrXKXo
