Proxy,Dan Deacon - Learning To Relax,"I somehow neglected to check out Dan Deacon's 2015 record *Gliss Riffer* when it came out, which is sad because I am a fan of this guy's difficult-to-categorize tunes. Checking it out now, I can recognize that it is a pretty disjointed record just in terms of flow, but there's so much to love here on a track-by-track basis. The standout for me is ""Learning To Relax"", which is the quickest 6:45 I've ever experienced. It taps into elements of maximalist music, namely due to its extremely active percussion paired with the typical robotic vocal layering and constantly-moving harmonic lines. The lyrics are nice, even if pretty indecipherable outside of looking at lyric sheets. The vocals carry the emotion and intent behind them well, and this song puts me in a super good mood.","Spotify Acapella 147 Times Exponentially Layered, only on ebaynetflix",https://open.spotify.com/track/05qa4YAJgUWH7A2e4Bxaz9

",Broken Social Scene - 7/4 (Shoreline),"Oh, man. I'd completely forgotten that this band existed - their first two albums form an integral part of the soundtrack of my late highschool into early college, courtesy of one of the other SALSAzens, Alteq. What's more, this song in particular has a nice crunchy odd time signature. Enjoy!",it's coming it's coming it's hard,https://open.spotify.com/track/5PurHGjwfAQel15O4ZIiGu
Makyo,Amon Tobin - Nightlife,"Okay, so, short blurb, as my wrists are killing me, but! I've been listening to a lot of Amon Tobin recently, and I noticed something about this track. Namely, I recognized one of the songs that's sampled! It's Voodoo, by Les Baxter. [Here it is](https://open.spotify.com/track/0tw3KO7Rq4BzATU2Ebtmhf?si=OWWpRuUjQbet4VhPSrWrAA) in a medley (where I heard it first), starting at 2:55. The corresponding melody shows up in Nightlife at around 2:00. I love how much jazz early Amon Tobin sampled.",*bongos intensify*,https://open.spotify.com/track/1xZWd0EYAK16JpRdguF4Nr
Peri,Disasterpeace - The Midnight Wood,"Disasterpeace is one of my favorite recent musical artists who works in the genre of video game music, and Hyper Light Drifter is one of my favorite soundtracks of all time. It's mysterious and moody and peaceful, with a sense of emotional depth.  ",*ḱerberós-ify,https://open.spotify.com/track/2trHjktny14AoWY2XxdDQv?si=hrwUDhHxRN2_eRWiPLvJwg
