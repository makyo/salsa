Makyo,Magic City Hippies - Hush,"This is a strange genre-bender of a song. It actually showed up on my discover a couple of weeks back, but now that I'm done with travel and company (and thus familiar, comforting music), I've been going back through stuff I found a bit ago and giving things a more thorough listen. Bonus points to ""Goddamn girl, so flexible! Is that possible with a popsicle?"" as one of the best lyrics I've heard in a bit.",Spopsicle,https://open.spotify.com/track/2hup7lQB1vMfVTemkfljLR
Lorxus,This Will Destroy You - They Move on Tracks of Never-Ending Light,"I've probably already talked about This Will Destroy You and it's something of a basics-of-postrock band, but I listened to it a lot on Friday while working for most of the day on the Great Designer Search 3 (fingers crossed) so here it is again - a single suspended moment of melancholy calm.",Simpleflips,https://open.spotify.com/track/3cIG78oBauowzEbkBwWADN
Proxy,Closer - Gift Shop,"I don't often check out a lot of screamo, much less skramz. Skramz is a subset of screamo that is attempting to be stylized more like the late-90s roots of screamo. It takes a lot of elements from hardcore punk and typical emo songwriting structure, aiming to perfectly capture its desired intensity. I prefer this approach to a lot of other screamo, as it will wear its frustration on its sleeve in a way that I love in hardcore, post-punk, and post-hardcore.

Anyway, Closer! A Brooklyn-based act, *All This Will Be* is their first LP and it feels fully-formed and well-realized. Having a poet as your lead probably helps with the lyrics that deliver their intent while also layering their explicit purpose with clever wording and symbolism. The vocals here cut through these old-school pummelling instruments, and there's plenty of moments of quiet. The track I selected off of this record, ""Gift Shop"", the true opening track, has a lot going on. Between its fiercely bitter lyrics where the role of the narrator makes full sense once the song is over, its aggressive drive, and occasional dips into black metal traditions, it makes for a gripping listen. Definitely a band to keep your eye on, if aggressive shouty music is your thing.",Skramziflamz,https://open.spotify.com/track/4aJWaUXiW1yy901VvittJ7?si=Q1GEpiMIQd-k53RsYRiMWQ
