Lu,"Neil Patrick Harris, Hedwig and the Angry Inch Cast - Midnight Radio","There are two reasons for this choice--one more personal and one absolutely dorky. I'll start with the personal one first, because at least it gives me a semblance of weight.

<i>Hedwig and the Angry Inch</i> is one of those musicals that came into my life pre-college, before I knew the grand scope of all kinds of alternative musical theatre. Going to high school in Concord, NC, there wasn't a lot of genderqueer imagery basically anywhere save for one or two friends I had, so as a budding and (at that point) unknowingly genderqueer person myself, I was thirsty for anything to give me alternative views. David Bowie was a big part of that, but so was John Cameron Mitchell and Hedwig. While I was still barely out of my internalized homophobia stage as a (then) gay man, I did understand how important Hedwig was to me, exposing me to gender and queerness both apart and together as a spectrum and a glorious thing to celebrate and work with, not against.

I am sure we could have a long discussion on whether <i>Hedwig and the Angry Inch</i> is the best representation of those things, but this is my personal connection and not anything more. I love Hedwig, and I think I always will.

More nerdily, while in Australia I watched all of <i>Jojo's Bizarre Adventure: Diamond Is Unbreakable</i> and, because I am this kind of person, felt the need to give Lu a Stand. I couldn't decide whether to pull from musical theatre or more traditional Jojo-esque music for its name, so I split the difference. Its name is Midnight Radio, and has two other powers, Exquisite Corpse and Wicked Little Town.

I told you it was nerdy.","<i>Green Circle With Three Black Marks</i>, an art piece that speaks to a generation.",https://open.spotify.com/track/5Dr2D9wIuWo8kKVZi0cMyF
Lorxus,Dave Brubeck - Blue Rondo Ã  la Turk,"The attentive longtime SALSAlite will recall that I have a weakness for weird time signatures passed off in a charming, non-wanky way, and this, in 9/8 time, is no exception. Enjoy!","It's kinda fucked up how they pushed the dude who first discovered irrational numbers off a boat to drown, but, like, I was deeply upset when I first encountered the Weierstrass function, so I guess I understand.

Veyote,Chris Lake - Give Her Right Back (feat. Dances With White Girls),"Ever since Claude VonStrokeâ€™s [Dirtybird](https://dirtybirdrecords.com/) imprint won [Mixmagâ€™s Label of the Decade](http://mixmag.net/feature/the-top-50-labels-of-the-decade) award earlier this year, I feel like thereâ€™s been a trend recently of more house tracks in similar styles to what the label has been known for years for - groovy & chunky beats, solid production, unorthodox synth design, and completely strange yet somehow catchy vocal hooks. Iâ€™m a fan of this sound a lot. The underground is slowly emerging and people are discovering great club music again.

Anyway, here's a lovely little song about a sex-starved adult male, probably at some social gathering with others of his own age, who kindly asks a stranger he's never met before to borrow his date for an undeterminable amount of time, with the the condition that he'll give her right back.",Hey can I borrow your Spotify?,https://open.spotify.com/track/6nzC3PRVLiPPcUuem4e4DL
Alteq,Baths - Yeoman,"Baths came out with Cerulean before my last year in college, and was kind of foundational in how my music tastes shifted and expanded. Obsidian was an equally vital release for me as well, and an interesting work as a whole. Will's ability to cover a completely different tone so well really solidified him as one of my favorite artists. Could not be more excited for this new album, if Yeoman is any indication of it. It feel like Will has a lot to show for the 4 years sine Obsidian.",Once in a Spoot Moon,https://open.spotify.com/track/6vgAKXC5y7TRF7IGtQqXYR
Makyo,"Vulfpeck ft. Antwaun Stanley - Birds of a feather, we rock together","This is just pure, unabashed funk soul, and I'm so, so glad folks are still producing stuff like this. Not everything needs to be complicated, and I'd do well to remember that. I found Vulfpeck through [Fugue State](https://open.spotify.com/track/2Ux3BFgzXm0YoD37nBQjJt) and have been keeping an eye on them ever since.",Stage Rhodesify,https://open.spotify.com/track/7jCalGVeStsbqIZ1YGVS7F
Amdusias,Oathbreaker- 10:56 / Second Son of R.,"I'll say first: the [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMTAkIDRHiA) for this pair of tracks is pretty important to my experience of it, so that's my preferred way to listen. I've also included Spotify links, though!

The other day, I fell into a hole of thinking about Deafheaven's 2013 album [Sunbather](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunbather_(album)). It's one of those albums that I love, but don't understand its popularity: as the highest-reviewed album of 2013, it nevertheless comes with scores of ""it's really accessible, for a black metal album, 10/10"" and ""you might like this even if you don't like black metal, still a lot of screaming, 9/10"" type reviews.

In any case, I only bring this up because this process is what lead me to think way too much about the ""new genre"" that Deafheaven was doing ([Blackgaze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackgaze), a word of which I am not a fan), finally leading me to revisit all of those bands I'd checked out in passing in ~2014, ending up at last year's new Oathbreaker album, *Rheia*.

Holy shit.

Trust me when I say that this track (well, pair of tracks, but they're clearly one song) is *powerful*, and doesn't quite go where you expect. The vocals are as in-your-face as I'd expect, but with more anguish than it's probably healthy to have in one place at one time. It feels deeply personal, and emotional in a way that almost no metal album I've listened to recently does. It's a furious song, but not thrash metal ðŸŽ¶ GONNA EXPLODE, I'M SO MAD, OOO YEHHHHH ðŸŽ¶ fury.

Just, wow, those vocals, those drums, I never knew how much I needed more angry, incredibly loud shoegazey growly crunchiness in my life. Oddly specific? Sure, but it works~",Spanahmenah,https://open.spotify.com/user/forneuslex/playlist/771Oklx9k4gTbFIiXoGrkP
Peri,Louis Cole - Weird Part of the Night,"This song is my anthem. There's something incredibly charming and interesting about how Louis Cole dives deep into lo-fi funky indie pop despite obviously having the chops to be making something much more produced. His tunes are both predictable yet surprising, heartfelt yet ironic. A careful and measured self-aware, paradoxically forced yet genuine. It's weird hipster music done right.",Doo doo do do dootify,https://open.spotify.com/track/7p0taeJ0uDyX6tatQtxjjl
