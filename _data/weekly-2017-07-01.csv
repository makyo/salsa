Peri,Frost* - Heartstrings,"I've been in love with Frost* since I discovered their debut Album Milliontown years ago. Frost* is a solid prog rock band, though unlike many Prog brands which couch themselves in the styles of classic rock, Frost* reaches out to incorporate electronic and modern pop elements. I love their heavy beats and engaging melodies, their strong musical identity, and their complexity. More please.",Spotify,https://open.spotify.com/track/2Jnt7jrwyX1oEy1yu92M7D
Proxy,Charisma.com - NOW,"Charisma.com is a group I will always vouch for, even if I have to look at translation notes due to my pitiful knowledge of Japanese.  Reminds me of my -hardcore- teenage weeb days.  But, *ahem*, anyway.  They're a fun Japanese electro-rap group.  The first album, which this track is off of, is reflective of the environment the two members of this group still operate in as women in the working world (as they maintain their office worker life in addition to being an MC and producer respectively).  NOW continues the energy established in the first track, HATE, and amps up the aggression with enough variation production-wise to make the repeat of the two main hooks never get old.  Lyrically, it's rather biting too, and MC Itsuka's flow is untouchable.  Just a really solid track.",spittyspottiflittyfly,https://open.spotify.com/track/2lROaqPuV1eI6Q4OPyW2RN
Makyo,Everything Everything - Cough Cough,"I love percussive vocals and always find myself wanting more whenever I find a song that utilizes the voice like that. Cough Cough is a wonderful example, with the way both the lyrics and the duration of syllables are used. A hecka good find from my Discover. It also comes up in Igorrr's [Houmous](https://open.spotify.com/track/0Zy1tSVAQ8pIugxsEbeAar) from the recent Savage Sinusoid, but I'm not sure how much that counts, given the nonsensical nature of the lyrics. Another example is Zeal and Ardor's [Blood in the River](https://open.spotify.com/track/1OLobd97VcA9vbbUUcHh1k) --- this time with actual lyrics!

There's a reason for this, too! When you sit down and try to catalog sound that are used in speech (and some that aren't), you wind up with different classes of consonants along two axes: the first axis is where in the mouth the consonant happens. For instance, you might have a bilabial consonant, which uses just the lips, like b, p; or a dental consonant like t, d, or th (yes, t and d are more complicated, but stick with me). The other axis is how the air is used. You can have a fricative, where the air stream continues while being modified by the position of the tongue or lips. For dental, this can be th, for labiodental --- using the teeth and lips --- you get v and f.

The percussive noises are almost all plosives, though, which fall along the second axis. This is when the air is stopped completly, and then released, sometimes with additional pressure behind it. This gets you b, p, t, d, g, and k, plus a lot of other sounds not really used in English. When lyrics include lots of words or syllables that start with these consonants, you can make a vocal line very percussive. If you try and avoid them, like in Hiatus Kaiyote's [Mobius Streak](https://open.spotify.com/track/08o9yCplgxLM11ymhvkbl8), you wind up with a very liquid sounding vocal line.

AND! When you give Makyo the slightest chance to justify her music degree, she'll use it. Imagine that :3c",spiflooty,https://open.spotify.com/track/2SWVjpzR8VlLBfExHYD6Pk
Lu,Yeasayer - Divine Simulacrum,"""Divine Simulacrum"" is a song that deserves to have a short film devoted to it, which really speaks to the cinematic quality of all of Yeasayer's work. Their songs have a breadth that more on-the-nose ""art"" bands lack. Where Yeasayer shines is marrying this mythic quality of their music to solid ideas--nothing meanders, nothing feels frayed or half-finished. I could have posted ""I Am Chemistry"" or ""Silly Me"" from this same album and said the same things, and that is a good thing. Yeasayer are consisently idea-heavy and concept-focused.",Spotify,https://open.spotify.com/track/4B7yLkxlNsmByJaXs84wkQ
Amdusias,"The Library- You Don't Need No Doctor, Sugar","The Library is one of those bands that I always wish had made it past a single EP, because they're great, but plenty of bands never do, I guess!

Anyway, this is from their four-track demo, which is the only thing that they ever recorded (don't believe Spotify, which has several records by a different, much later, country band of the same name??), and it's mid-to-late-00s perfection from a time when ""indie"" was a genre. If you liked The Bravery or We Are Scientists or any of those other ""uptempo peppy indie bands with secretly depressing lyrics"" from that point in time, you'll probably really dig this, and it's been stuck in my head since Tuesday.

Bonus fact: one of the two remixes on this album is by ""DJ Skrillex"", aka ""Skrillex but long enough ago that he was still putting DJ in his name because it was cool."" It has over a hundred times as many plays as any of their other songs, presumably because it comes up in searches for ""Skrillex"" :)",sportiflop,https://open.spotify.com/track/4cfNI3vZDWzOFpBv8ywNT7
Alteq,World/Inferno Friendship Society - Cats Are Not Lucky Creatures,"What can I say, it's a fun track from a great band. It's even in my workout playlist. Also it features the lyrics ""cause i'm a cat"" so there's that too.",Spiffy,https://open.spotify.com/track/6R8hILt460aEIMuPHuU3IX
