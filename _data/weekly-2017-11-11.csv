Lorxus,Dawn of Midi - Dysnomia,"My pick this week is actually an entire album, because the song boundaries are thin to nonexistent. Dawn of Midi, suggested to me by Lunostophiles as ""very Lorxus and Makyo"", turned out to be just that - tightly controlled, stripped down and austere, but all-engulfing, with a surprising intensity to it for something so minimalistic. Go listen to it!",silverladder.com - 11/11,https://open.spotify.com/album/6PjiBtHmHD7uwYpTzaZbmb
Proxy,Iglooghost - White Gum,"This record came as a surprise, despite Makyo talking about it beforehand. I was catching up on records that I've missed this year, and up came this record, with a cute cover and the description of being ""extremely maximalist"". Which, to be fair, describes this entire record, but is also what I'm about (I'm a cat that knows what they like). It's busy, buzzing, skittering and consistently has neat ideas going on. It's the perfect record for my hyperfocusing brain and is one of the best of the year for me.

This track in particular, which samples ""Naila"" by AJ Tracey in a method akin to most nightcore productions, with heavily pitch-shifted-up vocals accompanied by ribcage-shattering bass. I would say that this is akin to SOPHIE mixed with Aphex Twin in terms of raw production due to these mixed up vocals, the plasticity of a lot of the percussion, the skittering breakcore nature of it along with its strong ear for melody. Iglooghost is one hell of a recent inspiration for music composition for me, with something interesting always going on, and ""White Gum"" is a good summation of their work.","hey friends can you really believe that in the year 2017 one of the best electronic tracks samples a rap track that goes hard on the Yu-Gi-Oh! references because i can totally believe it, also, spotify",https://open.spotify.com/track/0eGyjuJAfarmZzhE1XGcWQ
Amdusias,Bent Knee- Terror Bird,"So I decided to listen to this album after Makyo sent me a different track from this album, which I could best describe as ""I have no idea what's going on but I enjoy this a lot.""

This is pretty much the story of the rest of the album: ""oh hey, there's a calliope, then two measures of blast beats, then they get bored of that and go back to the alternative rock thing, okay""; the opening track isn't quite as whiplashy, but it sure is great.",What's green and sits on your front porch?

Alteq,Spoon - Inside Out,"I dig how Spoon let most of this song exist as an instrumental, with the lyrics existing as an enhancer to SPoon's mastery of groove.",Spotsakovich,https://open.spotify.com/track/7qCZgvV98j6RjUULW1s1it
Makyo,Röyksopp - Electric Counterpoint III. Fast - RYXP True To Original Edit,"Reich is one of those composers where, if you ask me my opinion on him, I'll generally say 'meh', but if you ask me to name some of his songs, I'll generally have a lot that I really like. I'm not sure what it is about him that makes me say no in general, but yes in specific. I even wrote about him a bit in the [post about genre](http://strangeanimals.likingstrange.audio/2017/09/20/sound-design-and-genre-tags/).

Anyway, like him or not, one of the pieces I did is Electric Counterpoint, and the reason comes from this song. I was prowling around through Röyksopp's site years ago and stumbled across their Tracks of the Month, little one-offs they'd make and offer each month. This was one of them. It really tickled me to see a song in 3/4 massaged into 4/4 and set to a beat.",Not Spotify? Really!? How are we going to make puns now?
