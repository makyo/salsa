Peri,Phideaux - Microdeath Softstar,"Sometimes I just crave some comfortable classic rock soundingish Prog type music. When I get that jones I crack open a nice can of Phideaux. They've got lovely guitar riffs, organs, weird time signatures, meedly meedly solos, occasional saxaphones, and wonderfully morbid psychadelic lyrics. What's not to love?",In hoc Spotify vinces,https://open.spotify.com/track/2NozQm2dYJTZl8K3qbBOWr
Lu,Nick Drake - Things Behind the Sun,"Blame Griffin McElroy for this one. On his new podcast <i>Wonderful</i>, Griffin brought up how Nick Drake's music is a recurring fall soundtrack for him. Superficially this just prompted me to go listen to Nick Drake as well, but it also got my brain thinking on what fall music means. There isn't really Thanksgiving holiday music, and while I love Halloween music it's not <i>all of fall</i>, so it's an interesting thought. What music encapsulates an entire season, from lyrics to just the mood.

Nick Drake is definitely one of those artists. His music feels like a brisk October day with some leaves on the ground and a warm coffee or apple cider in your hand. It's warm, cozy, a little sombre but not overly so. Drake evokes that changing, pensive mood accurately and with beauty.

Happy autumn, y'all.","The slowly dying landscape of the world, burning with sunset foliage that will soon give way to the bone branches of winter.",https://open.spotify.com/track/2u6PeEPCbQUP656PbSi7AH
Makyo,Django Django - Found You,"Dunno how to classify the sound other than ""tired tenors' choir"". That also includes [Boys Latin](https://open.spotify.com/track/178yi3jvbIHwnaxeAVUCD9). Bonus points for Django being a friend's dog's name, and double bonus points for double Django.",Yeah,https://open.spotify.com/track/3AQWlrP7KVq9LIsO0vd0cm
Amdusias,Rapsody - Power,"So, this album has a million good guests on it, but this track features Kendrick Lamar, who's slightly popular these days, I guess.

I don't actually have that much to say here: this track is great, the flows are incredible, and that ultra-gritty sawtooth Royksopp bassline drills directly into my head in the best way possible.",Spoof!,https://open.spotify.com/track/4DxaBl7XTThDb9zRZjIWOB
Lorxus,The Books - Smells Like Content,It's finally come to my attention that I haven't put up one of my favorite songs here! Smells Like Content has a rich sonic landscape and surreal but evocative lyrics - the perfect thing to celebrate a rainy afternoon after a week of surreal nightmares.,The center of the sun,https://open.spotify.com/track/4OnYvmKZxbKRX1atDKWab9
Proxy,Yaeji - Last Breath,"I keep forgetting about if I’ve talked about Yaeji on SALSA before, as I’ve brought her up pretty consistently when chatting with everyone else. They’re a solid fresh face in house music, dreamily blending Korean and English into her work lyricism and applying a lot of seamless vocal tricks into house music that I would more often listen to while stoned rather than in a club.

‘Last Breath’ is completely different in that regard, as it has a driving pulse to it and is structured lyrically like a makeup tutorial. This is primarily the reason for the linked YouTube video in this week’s playlist, namely because the video for this song is a makeup tutorial set to a very 90’s house track. It’s instantly catchy and once you actually pay attention to what the words are saying, its perspective and very timely point are that much more clear and upfront.","YouTube, apply directly to the forehead.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pglE79xAGlA
