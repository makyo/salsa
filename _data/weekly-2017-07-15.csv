Amdusias,Allie X- Paper Love,"When I typed the title of this track, I got a message from Lu that just said ""I LOVE THAT YOU ARE CHOOSING PAPER LOVE""

That's probably a decent review. But that notwithstanding: all of her last album CollXtion II is great, genuinely solid pop jams that somehow manage to avoid hitting my ""okay it's another pop song with trap hi-hats okay Katy Perry did this already, next"" buttons.

Because yeah, it's not exactly *new*, but it's executed to a near-perfect degree, and at this point, that's most of what matters to me in pop. I'll be singing along to this for a while.",Fspotify,https://open.spotify.com/track/2QffgsYVZkvMQsZmQdgf2L

Lu,Fire Inc. - Nowhere Fast,"Every other month or so I go through a small but feverish week where I listen to a metric ton of Jim Steinman's music. Much like how I feel about the Wachowskis, Jim Steinman is unabashedly exactly what he wants to be, and no matter how cheesy it might seem, it never comes across as anything but earnest. His style of ""Wagnerian rock"" usually means every song is seven to twelve minutes long, but they are relentless songs that demand to be listened to. Jim Steinman writes emotions in twenty-foot high neon lights, towering over the landscape of the song, bathing it in an impressive, unyielding glow.

Sure, we can all make easy jabs at Meat Loaf's general schtick, or the wanton absurdity of the video for ""Total Eclipse of the Heart"" or ""It's All Coming Back to Me Now"" but I say, lean into it. Lean into the untethered emotions, the big voices and driving guitar and piano. Nothing makes you feel more alive than a good, solid Jim Steinman indulgence.",Spotify,https://open.spotify.com/track/4xtA4d04ORxfhDnNd7seLv

Proxy,Angel Olsen - Shut Up Kiss Me,"No long-winded explanation this week about production or lyricism or how I fell into this.  This just rocks, it's earnest as heck and I resonate strongly with it.",Sboggle,https://open.spotify.com/track/5uZLsGY9fknBd5Rxr7AIss
Veyote,The Mary Nixons - Adrian,"New side-project from Mat Zo and The Knocks. Super weird and super different for both artists, but I’m with it. It’s as if they wanted to create DJ Snake-tropical house but their own way in 2017.",Spotify,https://open.spotify.com/track/7GAOQ8MtrE35VOIwf49l3k
Lorxus,Dengue Fever - Sni Bong,"On the one hand, Cambodian pop + psychedelic rock = upsettingly catchy. (Source: professional mathematician) On the other, heh heh, Bong. You probably recognize this from Night Value's weather forecast.",lo zgike cu spofu,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3eLHR0-UxQ
