Duster,Mothers - BLAME KIT,"Really anticipating Athens GA-based Mothers’ second album which comes out next month! This is the first of two singles they’ve released from it and it shows the band eschewing their folky sound in favor of an anxious art rock sound that reminds me a lot of Palm, especially in the jittery fist minute before it calms down into a haunting dirge that continues for the rest of the track. While I’m a pretty big fan of Mothers’ debut, I’m glad to see the whole band taking on more of a prominent role this time.

Proxy,Iglooghost - Black Light Ultra,"A revival of the weeklies the same week as two new EPs from Iglooghost dropping?! It must be my birthday! (Wait, no, that was months ago, I am not a child of summer, please stop showering me with gifts there's only so much room in my tiny apartment im gay and drowning)

But seriously, there's a lot to love about ʺBlack Light Ultraʺ. It has a darker tone to it compared to the stuff off *Neo Wax Bloom*, much like everything else off of *Steel Mogu*. It allows itself to have fun with that, though, with most of the darkness coming from the subwoofer-busting bass tones. The main synth line is actually pretty breathy and high and the stuttery vocal samples are akin to what you would hear in a Nightcore remix. Add in really active percussion and an operatic vocal line into this and you get something really interesting that's just as likely to be dropped at a rave as it is to be listened to on repeat on commutes. It's just a really solid hyperactive banger.

Also that vocal sample is a Danny Brown sample. therefore this track is the hole that was made for me

Makyo,Arthur Honegger - Concertino for Piano & Orchestra,"OKAY SO

I originally found this piece through [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWeB1HkSO_U) (I didn't use it as the link because the sound quality is really awful) and hahahahAHAHAHA

I have so many questions. Why do shadows of instrumentalists lunge out at her from behind a screen? Why are the strings so menacing? Is the conductor disappointed or merely paternal (or are those just mixed up in my head)? Why is the piccolo player sitting on the ground, surrounded by chairs? When they were filming this, what did the orchestra thing, having to wait while the whole stage was rearranged?

Anyway, it's a rockin' piano piece, I really like it.","Spootles (but seriously, peep the YouTube link)",https://open.spotify.com/track/7LnZjhF1OqVOjuh3zQWPdO?si=gvyJAwANTE6qnLN2ivfcGQ
Amdusias,You Drive- Hold On,"*You Drive* is the collaboration between Jasmin Kaset and Makeup and Vanity Set, and I have to say that the addition of a vocalist really completes the retrowave sound that MAVS is particularly known for. Come for the synths ripped straight from the 80s, stay for the haunting vocals, maybe watch Kung Fury while you're here.",Makeup and Vanity Spot,https://open.spotify.com/track/1CNtYpFFBDWA0LeHxxtAnO?si=GMgGza9pRIigRG3Uqu52jA
