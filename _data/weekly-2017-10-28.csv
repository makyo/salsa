Makyo,Esperanza Spalding - Good Lava,"This song is kinda baffling? Like, it's a bit chaotic harmonically, but the melody is...well, melodic enough that it doesn't come off as chaotic as a whole. Still, I can't really classify it. It's hitting a lot of ""it's like..."" buttons. Is it metal? Some of it reminds me of Haken. Is it math rock? Some of it reminds me of...uh...lots of that. Like if Save Us From The Archon fell asleep, or Don Caballero found an overdrive pedal on the side of the road. I'll just tag it as [SOME LADIES YELLING](https://open.spotify.com/user/drabmakyo/playlist/0FCeoseJG4CGy3TopwmEqQ), which is a real genre and I'll fight anyone who says otherwise.

Anyway, it's good :3","See this Spotify, watch this Spotify flooooow~",https://open.spotify.com/track/0SdxGQpFy67zAxNWQ0ftml

Amdusias,Frou Frou- Flicks,"This is a week in which I didn't listen to almost anything new, because work was constantly exploding, and then even the explosions were exploding. So let's go backwards and dig out something more foundational! Get to know the cat behind the scenes, or, something idk.

I will sometimes make reference to ""the four albums that got me through the worst year of my life"", without really enumerating or going into more detail. *Details* is one of those four (I'll spoil some possible future posts for you: the other three are *Origin of Symmetry*, *See the Sound*, and *Fox Confessor Brings The Flood*), and it's in regular rotation more than a decade later. Imogen Heap somehow manages to make every song resonate with me, even when I her lyrics are getting Mars Volta-level out there (still waiting to figure out what ""four-walled secret lies among the hessian"" means, after all).

The entirety of *Details* was a hugely impactful experience for me, and it's still one of those albums I can listen to basically any time I'm feeling bad, and I'll absolutely lose myself in it every time. Maybe you'll feel the same.",Spotifrou,https://open.spotify.com/track/1iFwvtvFNbQVcIXKBiBRqD
Lu,CHVRCHES - Call It Off,"I would have picked the entirety of <i>The Con X: Covers</i> for this week's Weekly, but that goes against the rules, so I picked one.

Realizing that Tegan & Sara have been around for more than a decade is wild, because I have vivid memories of listening to them while driving around Concord, NC with my high school friends. We'd sing along to mix CDs, and T&S would show up more than a few times. I know we're all getting older, and our childhood music grows older with us, but being reminded of it can still do magical things.

Tegan & Sara produced this album, <i>The Con X: Covers</i>, filled to the brim with people who most definitely listened to Tegan & Sara when they were growing up in some capacity. What you then hear in these covers are not just ""oh I love Tegan & Sara and want to do a cover of their music"", but the performers' deep sense memories of the songs. You get a snapshot of how these different tracks (and it is every track from <i>The Con</i>) affected the people who are singing them. CHVRCHES takes ""Call It Off"", already a sad song, and morphs it into something sad, but also intense and all-consuming while having hints of relief. It's that big CHVRCHES synth sound, pulled back and slowed down, creating an undulating wave of music behind Lauren Mayberry's vocals. It is metaphysically sad, and yet its major key instrumentation makes it feel hopeful, like finally finding how to slough off a lost love.

Just check out <i>The Con X: Covers</i>, y'all, it's so worth it.",Spotify for queer people,https://open.spotify.com/track/1uZy8GpfsZJmuZ6Tbjj9qT
Proxy,Dessa - Good Grief,"This was a difficult week! I had four tracks to choose from, including one that would be seasonally appropriate. But this track came out the day I'm writing it, and it's a tour de force from Dessa.

I've been writing a lot about songs about dealing with pain, whether that be from the position of a relationship or loss of someone important, or so on and so forth. But there's a healing phase, the pain eventually fades. The kind that leaves you a changed person. Add in a percussively-active ballad beat from Lazerbeak/Paper Tiger and you've got the environment that Dessa's direct lyricism thrives in with some excellent wordplay to augment it.

I don't have much more to add. It's just flooring me at a time I need to hear it the most.",SoundCloud! WAIT SHOOT IT'S NOT A SPOTIFY PUN HELP HELP HELP,https://soundcloud.com/doomtree/dessa-good-grief
