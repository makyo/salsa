Amdusias,Jinjer- Perennial,"Jinjer's been busy: they dropped a new EP the day that I'm writing this (the 11th), after a full length album last year.

This is the logical band for me to have ended up liking as a huge fan of Evanescence in high school who now happens to be much older and angrier.",Relevant 2019-themed Spotify Pun,https://open.spotify.com/track/0pTWH7sKVZBk7YC3DPbOtF?si=lEk6pIW-TKW9IvQGducfbA
