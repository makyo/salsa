Makyo,King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard - Rattlesnake,"So, I was handed this a while ago, and dang, it keeps coming up for me. This whole album seems to be mircotonal rock, and Rattlesnake is a good lead in. It's got that off-kilter feel that microtonal music comes with, but the beat driving it a long keeps it from sounding simply poorly done.

If you need less grungy microtonal music, Beyond 12 is a pretty good album. Though [Alien Warp Etude](https://open.spotify.com/track/7kKAMMOMf7ifTIFRyugDy0) is a *terrible* name, I think it's my favorite on there.",Flying Spotify Banana,https://open.spotify.com/track/0ZL30eQe4jC2x6nrnDRo0a
Amdusias,Shame- Dust on Trial,"I don't listen to a ton of post-punk, but if I like it as much as I liked this Shame debut, I should probably fix that, huh?

Proxy and I both got pretty into this album after it landed, and it's fairly easy to see why; the production is super tight, but somehow still raw, the vocal performances are dead-on, and the music isn't quite as straightforward as it seems at first listen. I'm really looking forward to what this band does in the future.",Shamify,https://open.spotify.com/track/3pJqM2XZG7fXcYKsEO7owh?si=eNqPAlwzQBKhd-RonBwnQA
Lorxus,Ed Harrison - Annul,"A little over-the-top, I know, but I can't quite shake the feeling that I've heard this somewhere else before, and I kinda like it. It's neat, in an '80s cyberpunk Neotokyo kind of way, and I've been in a Naking Weird Stuff mood lately, so it's been a nice addition to my soundtrack.",Neo-Spotopolis -- FUTURE YEAR: 2018,https://open.spotify.com/track/3UbdhEd5eo29MSyJgnxbab
Proxy,Rosemary & Garlic - Wintering,"I stumbled upon Rosemary & Garlic, this neat take on folk pop, on just the right day. It's snowing in Boston as I write this, flakes gently coming down and not even accumulating as I'm so far into the city during work that the snow immediately becomes slush. ""Wintering"" is a song that combines the nature of most indie folk pop with downtempo dream pop, offering just enough production to make the work feel simultaneously grander and more intimate. The composition feels rather wintery and cold, with the enough warmness to get the intimate ideas captured in the lyrics. It's nice, especially on a cold day in front of a space heater while drinking a fresh cup of coffee.",Spotty showers of snow that slushify the streets.,https://open.spotify.com/track/6g2A476aR3nNO3U6ddYRM8
Knacker,They Might Be Giants - When the Light Comes On,"TMBG's new album has plenty of depressing, bleak, and morbid moments, but this track especially gave me chills.",Asplundh,https://open.spotify.com/track/7243IoHGzP09o8SXpnmecl
