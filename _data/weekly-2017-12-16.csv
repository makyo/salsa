Alteq,Ollie MN - until I see you again,"An artist I had found back through Vine. I really like their voice and sound, etc. And it seems they comin' out with music soon which I'm a fan of.",Big Spootify,https://open.spotify.com/track/0or8au72kopvX6c6JYB5hh
Lu,Dessa - Fire Drills,"It's always a good day for new Dessa, and ""Fire Drills"" is far and away one of the best tracks she's ever pressed. Never one to be shy about her thoughts, this is still Dessa's most frank and political song, dealing with being a woman in the world in this year of our dark gods 2017 (nearly 2018!).

I don't want to frontload this song too much--it's worth just sinking into for a few spins. But be on the lookout for some of Dessa's best lyrics, like ""tell Patient Zero he can have his rib back"".",A whole night of licking wrapping paper to truly feel the Christmas spirit.,https://open.spotify.com/track/1X5zQcYMf7Np85LbdLdSV7
Makyo,Samuel Barber - Excursions No. 1 Un poco allegro,"I was reminded this out of nowhere this week! This is one of those things that I heard back in high school that got me really into classical music newer than the romantic period. It was also one of the first scores I bought simply so that I could study it (the other two that showed up at around the same time were both Verdi's and Mozart's requiems - my mom started to get concerned about my interest in death for a bit there :P).

Anyway, this one's about trains and I also really like trains, so...you know, perfect match.",Lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots of spotify,https://open.spotify.com/track/2mwlFHhfyFAUMrp5oWT8W3
Lorxus,Rodgers and Hammerstein/Yul Brynner - Puzzlement,"I'm not generally given over to a love of musicals, but the Rodgers and Hammerstein release of The King and I is perhaps the second movie I ever saw, and this is my favorite song from it - perhaps more relevant that one might hope in these troubled days, and certainly relevant to my studies in mathematics.","If my Lord in Heaven, Buddha, show the way - every day I do my best for one... more... day! BUT! IS! A puzzlement.",https://open.spotify.com/track/4nfRBzqiQmG6MBzZReRLYp
Proxy,Clap Your Hands Say Yeah - The Vanity Of Trying,"Clap Your Hands Say Yeah are a bit of an interesting experience when looking at their progression. From humble beginnings and popularity due to their down-home DIY presence being spread around music blogs around 2006 to a blown-out sophomore record (that I will firmly defend) and several records of trading in better production for inconsistent songwriting. As band members left, however, frontman/singer/guitarist Alec Ounsworth's vision has taken hold and begun to amorphously process itself. The previous record before this one, *Only Run*, was inconsistent but provided interesting experimental moments (""Impossible Request"" being one of the most impressive songs in the band's catalog). Their newest record, *The Tourist*, is the most consistent and impressive since the band's debut, freely operating outside of the realm of hype that followed them even through to their third album.

Speaking of operating under the safety of lowered expectations, that's exactly what ""The Vanity Of Trying"" is all about! The lyrics to this song are rather straightforward (which is a rarity for this band), but freely stating in the hook that ""...[they] can be whatever whatever whatever whatever whatever whatever whatever [they] want!"". Attach this to a slick post-punk-style song that's still distinctively CYHSY (delay and reverb on Ounsworth's distinctive vocals, synths soaring on top of instrumentals that wouldn't be out of place on a mid-00s indie rock act) and you get the sense that Ounsworth is finally having more fun with this project than he has in year.

The song also distinctively calls to mind how easy and appealing it is to fall into the rut of doing the same thing over and over again (""Going looking for easy solutions//Clicking heels and telling me no place like home""), and how not being held to high expectations can ease one into this freeflowing amorphous identity (""Sometimes I’m under the pressure//Other times I’ve nothing to lose""). I'm all about this band doing a meta-commentary on their own identity and its newfound freedom to do what they want, and they manage to pack this entire idea into a song that is a standout in their catalogue but still distinctively them.",Spronk,https://open.spotify.com/track/53vmrOglO3qSjWaabobEia
Amdusias,Meshuggah - I,"SALSA routinely descends into djent puns, despite the fact that I'm pretty sure there's never been a djent track in any one of these weekly posts.

(Maybe someone did Animals as Leaders once. Anyway.)

I'm fixing that by writing about ""I"", because a) it's really good, b) mine and Makyo's relationship has a lot of Meshuggah in its history, c) this song is the entirety of its EP, and the phrase ""one-song EP"" is really funny. Sorry for dominating your playlist this week. :3",Djentidjent,https://open.spotify.com/track/7ti7Zc0X1ONsqQ2tYh9OgL
