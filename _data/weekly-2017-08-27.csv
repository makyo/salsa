Duster,Kincaid - Parachute,"There's a sense of forlornness to the innocence of Athens Georgia-based pop ensemble Kincaid's sophomore album ""Kincaid Plays Super Hawaii"". This comes out the most in ""Parachute"", a midtempo ballad driven by weepy strings and childlike but charming vocals. Although the band was clearly influenced by Elephant 6 bands such as Beulah and Elf Power, Kincaid and this song in particular have a homespun generosity that many like-minded artists seem to lack.","""Kincaid Plays Super Hawaii"" (1999)",https://open.spotify.com/track/0a8I0oHC3qB0YS21AexSzb
Lu,Lesley Gore - It's My Party,"""But Lu,"" you might be saying as you stare at my pick this week, ""why Lesley Gore? Why not any of the other multitudinous musicians from the same time period doing roughly the same thing?"" Well, that's complicated, I guess. There are a lot of singers from the 60s that were on the same wavelength as Lesley Gore's style of music. Teen idols singing about teen love and teen heartbreak; it's a genre as old as popular music.

What really sets Gore apart is twofold--one is Quincy Jones' masterful producing, giving Gore's music a larger-than-life quality. Gore is not merely a forlorn teenager, she is <i>the</i> forlorn teenager, a deific iteration of a feeling. Jones double-layered her vocals in a lot of places, giving Gore's delivery this meta-planar quality. It's a lot to say that it just sounds mythic.

The second is that Lesley Gore just believes in her delivery. Even being ""the amazing 17 year old Lesley Gore"", as the album says on the cover, Gore has a world-weariness that other contemporaries did not have. This is the same singer who went on to sing ""You Don't Own Me"", which is anthemic even today. Basically, Lesley Gore is one of the best 60s post-carhop pop vocalists and we should all be enjoying her even today.","It's my Spotify, and I'll cry if I want to.",https://open.spotify.com/track/1Pq47iFLC5U7j8xeNiNcuS
Lorxus,Boards of Canada - nlogax,"Have you ever looked up, only to realize that all of a sudden, you're somewhere completely different than you expected? Or traipsed through a waking fever-dream, each event happening after the next without regard for internal logic? I guess what I'm saying is that I think I'm coming down with a cold.

Alteq,Donald Fagen - I.G.Y.,"Saw this album getting rec'd here and there, and while I own it, I hadn't given it its due. Solid track. Been a downtempo, tired weekend, so have a smooth sound.","Go get 'em, Sportify",https://open.spotify.com/track/6bzwsAtj4TqaBysLDrGiO3
Amdusias,clipping. - The Deep,"Short review: this is the best track about an African mermaid uprising that you'll hear this week.

Longer review: one of things that I really, really enjoy about clipping. as a band is how intensely technical Daveed's verses can get without it ever feeling like he's just doing it to show off. This is no different; much like their earlier track ""Taking Off"", his delivery gets consistently faster as the song continues, but here, it directly serves the narrative; as the conflict being described escalates, there are more words, more sounds, everything is louder, punchier, until eventually everything just disintegrates into a wall of actual noise.

I'm not at all surprised to hear something this high-concept from the only band to be [nominated for a Hugo](https://www.thewire.co.uk/news/46386/clipping-named-hugo-award-finalists) since the 70s, but I'm definitely pleased that this has me just as excited to hear the rest of this album as the lead singles from _Splendor and Misery_ did.",The Cloud®,https://open.spotify.com/track/6LHGNimbsz8tabfUDSujvH
Makyo,Nujabes - Luv (Sic),"Again with the cheating! Bad fox. This is actually six songs, rather than just one. However, it really works out to be more like a long, meandering love-letter of a lo-fi rap. I actually found out about Luv (Sic) (and Nujabes) through a [relatively silly video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAxgpHWtLC0) that went around a while back. It was used as backing music to slow-motion video of folks running in as silly a way as possible. I loved the music more than the video, so I went on a hunt and found all six 'movements'.

The songs themselves are a fascinating mix of lo-fi beats and remixed classical music backing a heartfelt love letter of a rap by Shing02. It each piece stands alone well enough, but taken together, it tells the story of a lost love - an ended relationship or a death (or both) - and of regrets and memories. I rarely encourage folks to take the time and sit down to listen to half an hour's worth of dense verse, but in this case, it's 100% worth it.

Plus, I'm still maudlin.

Nujabes died a while back, and I found a lot of fantastic memorial videos and songs, so a cursory search on YouTube will come up with quite a bit of good stuff.",Your Tube ..._lewd_,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJktY5gVIZA
Proxy,Yuragi - night is young,"Time for a band I found out about this week! Yuragi (揺らぎ) are a shoegaze act from Shiga prefecture in Japan, and that's literally all I know about them. They released a debut EP in early 2016 called ""Bedside"" that I've yet to listen to, but ""night life e.p."" from the tail end of 2016 is one of the more solid shoegaze EPs I have listened to in a long time. With a strong pop melodic ear adding to good drum work and layered, ethereal sonic textures, it just all makes for a good listen at dusk or night. 'night is young' is easily the standout single of this, with a catchy utterance of ""Give you my love"" repeated until the words permanently sink into your head. It's just a dang solid shoegaze track with good dreamy pop elements.",your tubular web site network account downloaded straight to your ear domain protocol,https://youtu.be/xgMD6efugcU?t=2m47s
