Amdusias,Snarky Puppy- Shofukan,"I *have* listened to some new music in 2018, but I'm writing about this one anyway for three reasons:
- It's an absolutely amazing bit of jazz.
- It's back on Spotify after the band decided that they were done with their Trent Reznor ragequit phase.
- I just bought tickets to their show here in SF.

Most people come to this band through *Lingus*, ten minutes of ""I wasn't sure you could actually assemble this many good musicians in one place without creating some kind of problem."" That's the last track off of 2014's _We Like It Here_; *Shofukan* is the first, and what an intro it is. Take the time to give it several listens, and at any point you want, hone in on some random part of the song, and you'll hear something cool. I've listened to this many, many times and I'm still finding new stuff in it. And isn't that kinda the best?",Snarkify,https://open.spotify.com/track/1BWsQm7kOBjK2aSFYg5HQZ
Lorxus,The Flaming Lips - Pompeii am Gotterdammerung,"I was thinking of listening to Romaplasm and finding something off there but I've been traveling through Switzerland for the past week and a bunch of stuff from the Flaming Lips got very firmly lodged in my head, so enjoy. ",Did you know that the Rhine doesn't have a single distinct source? It's true!,
