Monokhrome,Cate Le Bon - Magnificent Gestures,"Cate Le Bon's dazzling, heartfelt comeback LP, Reward, reaches its fever pitch here as the Welsh Wonder dials up her manic energy in this off-kilter kaleidoscope of an almost-pop song. Cate sings of anxiety, memory, the cruel passage of time, and the desire to connect despite it all, set to a juicy, bouncy arrangement with many surprising left-hand swerves, tethered to her razor-sharp Telecaster stabs. Cate's vocal on this track is one of Reward's most rousing, jumping around her register and spinning through a roulette wheel of emotions. Also worth hearing just for the funky interplay in the guitar and bass lines...","sportify but also Buy That Vinyl Dude

Makyo,Eric Whitacre - A Boy and a Girl,"There were several reasons I wound up majoring in composition, but Eric Whitacre was the reason I wound up focusing in choral music. Something about the sort of neo-romantic, occasionally neo-madrigal form appealed to me, not to mention the focus on dense, yet still tonal, harmonies and harmonic melodies (rather than a single melodic line, something frowned upon in general, and which got me in trouble with professors). I loved it all, especially the BYU choirs' renditions. Something about their velvety tone seems to fit a bit better than either more vibrato-heavy adult choirs or the pure, drill-like tones of, say, Layton's Polyphony choir or Harry Christophers' The Sixteen - weirdly, those voices pull of Lauridsen quite well; weird because Lauridsen's compositions can get awfully similar to Whitacre's.",Whitify,https://open.spotify.com/track/2wsMnTKbBI4doR40qViRiO?si=sPDXn8u0Sf-OJhW5edSmfQ
Proxy,Sacred Paws - Almost It,"Sometimes you just have to give it to a song's energy. Lyrically, ""Almost It"" does make sense in the context of the record while still being vague enough to work as a danceable single. The movement in this track is just unbelievable; busy in a way that makes it teeming with life, with an active rhythm section and and a brass section that gives an offbeat almost third-wave-ska vibe at times. I can't help but smile while listening to this track.",Spawtify,https://open.spotify.com/track/5UtyyI3WhHwjBIxWl4zUYz?si=1DA3lo5LR8KinMpYNkIcZg
Amari,Hirola - Perpetual Light,"A lush composition with gently shimmering strings, bubbling electronics and lush pads. It all wraps up into a beautiful 5 minute package.",SpootleFlea,https://open.spotify.com/track/5vDuGccgpc13iCMZLkgKWQ?si=gi1ig0YdTmabVREQ_bTaYQ
Amdusias,Her Name Is Calla - A Moment Of Clarity,"HNIC recently released their final album, *Animal Choir*. They knew going into the release that they were done as a band after this release, and oh boy does it show. I'm only occasionally a fan of vocal post-rock, but *Animal Choir* on a whole executes it brilliantly, and this track aches with all of the emotions brought by the end of an era. Overall, this entire release floored me, but I have to pick only one track, so here it is! Try not to weep like I did. :)",Animal Spots,https://open.spotify.com/track/6Nf5YlDkzkFE0OozK5Yrcz?si=QDtBGmyPTiOrDz4HJe4hmg
Colton R,ichikoro - James?,"I don't think I've ever not mentioned that I'm a Prog fan, especially the whole Prog-Metal/Prog-Rock/Fusion thing happening right now, but sometimes it all sounds so similar. Blame Polyphia, I'm not going to. It's nice when one can find something a little more fresh in the genre and I've been listening to ichikoro quite a bit lately. Quite Polyphia-like in style, there's still a good dose of jazz influence here. While many of their songs seem to draw heavily from the various Japanese flavors of Jazz and City-Pop, this song is just a little bit different and it stands out to me.",YooChoob,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lc2fEhH25g
