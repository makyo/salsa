Peri,Darth Vegas - Gritos Dulces,"Mr. Bungle caused me to go through musical puberty. I was your typical classic rock dork with occasional forays into classical and symphonic metal. Listening to Mr. Bungle flipped a switch in my mind that allowed me to start enjoying experimental music. There's still something nostalgic about the chaotic mishmash of genres, the weird dark sense of humor, and how Mr. Bungle basically didn't give a shit. These days, when I want to go back to that chaotic weird comfortable world, I tend to throw on Darth Vegas. I dig the cartoony black metal monster jazz. It wears its influences on its sleeves, but it does it so well I can't help but love it.",Sphagnumify,https://open.spotify.com/track/5gNGOKOO4L46lgDrBk89ag?si=qQgaNT8MRRWCIOCwwum2NA
Proxy,SZA - Prom,"Normally I’d be like “hell yeah let’s talk about seasonal tracks” but I’m still listening to stuff from my top albums of the year. SZA tracks are the gifts that keep on giving, and I appreciate them more and more with each passing week. “Prom” has a good usage of traditional synth music-sounding percussion going on here, and the hook of “Please don’t take it personal (like you usually do)” is absolutely infectious. Have some good R&B to settle into the end of the year with.",Spink,https://open.spotify.com/track/5yvhdo8FXbBsIllxv2Rr94
Amdusias,Hella- Biblical Violence,"This is a ""last weekly of 2017"" type pick: I've been working my way through a ton of year-end lists, catching up on a ton of music that was great this year, in a great year for music, so why not post some weird-ass math rock from 2002, right?

Biblical Violence is mostly notable for being one of those songs that, as a drummer, makes me say ""wait, you can do that? that's like...those are things. you can do. with drums. okay!"" I've been listening to this track for over a decade and I'm still not sure that I could even tell you much about its time signature, but I could tell you how the rhythms *feel*, and that's pretty cool I guess.

Zach Hill is some kind of inhuman math-beast, I'm pretty sure. If you don't believe me, go watch [a live recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdMDcG3zAEI), complete with the cleanest cymbal grab I've ever seen. :P",Spotimento,https://open.spotify.com/track/5ZdSxbZ5EXxT37tw5LY4Xg

Jasper ,"Phoenix Spreading It's Wings, writen by Hu Tianchuan and Dong Hongde preformed by the little giant Chinese Chamber Orchestra","Furry in a roundabout way, this is a composition for an instrument that pretends to be a bird while dressed as one. Phoenix Spreading It’s Wings is a 1956 virtuoso piece that adapts Shanxi folk songs about the Phoenix for an instrument called a Sheng, which during it’s seven thousand year history was used in Chinese opera to make the ethereal vocalizations of the mystical animal whom it’s appearance is designed to resemble. In addition to being a feat of musical prowess and a succinct demonstration of the sheng’s curious pholyphonic textures, the piece stands on its own, cleverly evoking imagery of the mythical bird dancing, soaring, and shaking off rain, with interjections of its ethereal voice. It's a favorite that I keep coming back to.",There are many recordings on both Spotify and YouTube. This is a good one in the link,https://youtu.be/N5Vh11JGmi8
