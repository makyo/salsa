Proxy,Makthaverskan - Demands,"Makthaverskan are unfair in how fun they are, especiaslly given the subject matter of most of their songs. They have this popppy approach to their post-punk, and it's as catchy as it is affecting. ""Demands"" exemplifies this well, featuring some of the best mixing on their work to date that allows the warm fuzz of the guitars to serve as a bed for Majna Milner's soaring vocals and the snares that punch through that haze and keep the work driving. What especially works well is all of the modulations, feeling like a part of a whole song while still being sonically interesting. It's a great listen if you want edge to your pop.",strålkastare,https://open.spotify.com/track/4zzdFJxJxoHa99rPUutmPn?si=FZf5GIctR2qrDdNxCNaV7A
Monokhrome,KEY - Honest,"After making his debut as part of K-Pop juggernaut SHINee, Kim Ki-bum stepped aside from the group during an incredibly eventful 2018 to release his first album of solo material, FACE. While it doesn't feature his own original songwriting or compositions, KEY's voice as a curator begins to show through here, and ""Honest"" serves as a great introduction to the a warm, danceable, and thoroughly entertaining album. Chillwave-reminiscent production comes to the fore here, complemented by snappy drum programming and bright washes of keys. Highlighting KEY's snappy syllabic wordplay, weightless and smooth vocal acrobatics, and bubbly synthesizers weaving around his voice, the track is rich but never cluttered, and its heart-on-sleeve earnestness and sauntering, summery energy make it one of the most impressive pop tunes I heard in 2018.",Playing during the climactic scene of The Summery Teen Lesbian Werewolf Movie You Wish You'd Grown Up With,https://open.spotify.com/track/4V5q1vLdQZvSDcpDGSsR52
Amdusias,"MONO- Nowhere, Now Here","...I literally just got that ""Nowhere"" and ""Now Here"" are spelled the same way.

ANYWAY.

I was joking on Mastodon earlier that my new brand has become ""bands with ridiculously metal names or album titles playing very chill or relaxing music"", and the eponymous track (well, with an extra comma) from the newest MONO record is no different. You might not expect a band with an album titled Mass Murder Refrain to be packed with this much crunchy horn-filled post-rock goodness, but *Nowhere Now Here* has finally claimed the title of ""first LP in 2019 that I enjoy a whole heck of a lot.""

If you've ever listened to my rambling about how \*Shels' *Plains of the Purple Buffalo* is a top-five post-rock album, you can't miss this one.",Post-Spot,https://open.spotify.com/track/6juUmEgk3NoTtfnafOPYFq?si=3oYCRtnuT4Sa9lpDjln-pw

Maddy,Weezer - No Scrubs,"So Weezer came out with a cover album, which is definitely not a thing I ever pictured myself saying in the year of luigi, 2019. It's...pretty okay! But I picked it this week mostly because it got me thinking of what goes into a good cover. While these are all competent pieces of music, none of them are very inventive. In fact, it feels like they spent most of their energy trying to sound as close to the original song as possible, rather than making a *good* song. Not that they're not good, just the energy isn't there to make them great. In fact, the Africa song that started all this sounds close enough to the original that I'd be hard pressed to tell them apart unless I played them back to back. I think they closest they get to owning a song is with No Scrubs, if only because it's closer to (some of) their millieu than the other songs they picked.

Also, scrubs are hecka comfy, so.",Weezify,https://open.spotify.com/track/3wQxUfquHLpgHoU6fo8Z50?si=1c-LnQbsRB24vegE6pVP1g
