Amdusias,Zola Jesus - Exhumed,"Holy shit this is SO INTENSE like, it's intense enough that I feel the need to write about it in all caps. But then I might trample Makyo's cooking schtick, so nope, just regular enthusiasm for today.

If you believe Spotify, *Okovi* is the second Zola Jesus album this year. It isn't actually (Stridulum came out in 2010, so I'm not sure why it's marked as having come out in August), but this is a fantastic release even without the qualifier of ""and she just released another album a month earlier!"" I was torn between doing this or ""Soak"", the track after it on the album, but I always come back to everything about this one: those really, really overblown strings, the distorted-to-hell kicks, even the really cool, vaguely kinky album art. THE DRUMS, WOW oh, right, I promised no caps lock, sorry.",/hug,https://open.spotify.com/track/2jtZ0EhKflhlG3jfWexInZ
Proxy,Deerhoof - I Will Spite Survive (feat. Jenn Wasner),"I really like Deerhoof. A lot. I was really looking forward to Mountain Moves, and it did not fail to disappoint. I feel as though this might be Deerhoof's most pleasantly-accessible album containing its most positive quirks. While not their best album, it contains a lot of repetitive hooks that manage to get me both dancing and feeling things. This is the exact case with ""I Will Spite Survive,' which has a lot of fun sounds to it along with the simple message of survival, even if it's out of spite and becoming the executioner in the end. I really resonate with it, and it reaches a fever pitch with a sudden modulation that I still find silly. It's a simple song that does emotionally affect me, and it's catchy as hell. Simple enough reason to make it my weekly this time.",sporkiknyf,https://open.spotify.com/track/3NgFKEW4iYeAqxRXGFTNd3

Lorxus,Muse - Map of the Problematique,"Did you know this is about a prophetic topic paper in economics? I didn't until a few months after I first listened to it. Anyway, enjoy a soundtrack to the ongoing apocalypse.","Paddling through a flooded deserted city center, the last copy on CD will float by you. You'll trade it for a cup of water later on.

Duster,Women - Group Transport Hall,"I don't know why it took me so long to give Women a listen, because this is seriously good stuff. Group Transport Hall is the 6th track from their self-titled debut, a mostly noisy, mathematic album that's broken up by a few micro-pop gems like this one. While it's only a minute long, it establishes a solid verse/chorus/verse structure with layered vocals that recall early Rogue Wave and Animal Collective's most stripped down material. Totally worth taking 60 seconds out of your day to check out.",Spobify,https://open.spotify.com/track/6De9HepiNzEpmB0YLiJGsi?si=zQWpb8HP
Makyo,Singularity - Print,"So Amdusias tweeted this the other day, mentioning that a lot of music they liked from Soundcloud now exists only as a YouTube video with about 100 plays.
