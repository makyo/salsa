Kailys,Vessels - Elliptic,Spooky atmospheric mood with beautiful sounds emerging from chaos. Electronic music with the heart of post-rock.,Places?,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPjN5GNpCTI
Makyo,Porcupine Tree - Anesthetize,"So this song has been on and off Spootles a few times over the years, and I was hoappy to find that it's back again! In particular, I'm in love with this live version from Tilburg - it's one of those live performances that tops the studio version, in my mind (which is an interesting conversation in its own right!). It's also well worth watching the [video from the concert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBfY86cktN0) if only for the hella drums.",Spiffify,https://open.spotify.com/track/5buRmG2pBjM8HlZAWIud5d?si=vDHR8qfkQYuPDs6fAtNn3g
Amdusias,Haken- Nil By Mouth,"This is the best ""maximal prog bullshit"" instrumental since The Dance of Eternity. It's just a shame that a Haken instrumental means you're missing out on the singer's ridiculous Beaker voice.",Progify,https://open.spotify.com/track/6TxtNgJO35MVGzIQgM5e0N?si=0lIodS-vSx2XlZimISeESg
