Traedon,Ayreon - Computer Eyes,Composition flows excellently and the seven minutes passes in an absolute flash. It's a joy to liten to.,~~I don't have Spotify so I can't vouge for it but I know it's on Youtube~~ I gotcha,https://open.spotify.com/track/0RV10Fcmfv9pqEbDj8gnDU
Proxy,Yasutaka Nakata - Give You More,"Yasutaka Nakata's latest record, *Digital Witness*, is mostly his take on the increasingly-popular future bass genre. It's pretty good stuff, but this closer here is a glistening comedown track with excellent production and feels like a good nightcap to an energetic DJ set. Something about the progression is pretty emotionally-fulfilling, too, probably thanks to those soaring but balanced highs. It's an excellent tune.",Sprongus,https://open.spotify.com/track/1S5pOi4NYMabwxE3reN2Aw?si=MaCRQxJzRHmUyKVDZPnvzA
Lorxus,"Saxon Shore - Secret Fire, Blinding Light","I don't think I've ever seen anyone say anything about this band so I'm going to! I like it, but the place it occupies between things like Iron & Wine on the folk rocky side and post-rock involving the accordion that I really can't remember right now... seems a little weird. There's a quality of faintness to it that I can't quite describe. Regardless, it's pretty good, so put it in your ears!",[accordions intensify],https://open.spotify.com/track/2pNwcQjKciwMcCsJJnumLL
Amdusias,Hookworms- Ullswater,"Some of this Hookworms album is total filler that needs to figure out how to get to the point. And then there's this track here: if you told me that I'd be really into a seven-minute-long-but-still-tightly-focused weird psychedelic synth odyssey, I'd...have not been surprised at all, probably, but I really am, and so there's this.",Ullspot,https://open.spotify.com/track/6FerCd5LaYFxG9djcbLGOQ?si=QX1mRkCsRa6j3vAoDKrsrw
Makyo,Ezra Furman - Driving Down to LA,"Ezra Furman came out with a new album recently, and I'm, surprisingly, all about it. I say surprisingly because, although I *love* [Restless Year](https://open.spotify.com/track/7lKhRwHEPeGBhKeCcyXKGC), the rest of his older stuff never really grew on me. For some reason, though, Transangelic Exodus really has. There's a *lot* of queer stuff going on in this album, and the fact that it's a) keeps talking about surgery and b) Furman will be in town to play a show four days before my surgery has me all ramped up! It's sorta one of those instances where you find something right as you need it. I had a similar experience with Against Me!, and a lot of really formative-for-me queer music.",Vocal fry so warm it leaves you feeling cozy,https://open.spotify.com/track/7dTJPGPxGym2JIeNYlSDSN
