Amdusias,Sweet Valley- Chameleon,"Not to be confused with the Herbie Hancock song, and in fact having nothing to do with it, here's this bit of plunderphonics weirdness.

I didn't listen to Eternal Champ 1 before this, but I love it: it's almost intentionally blown out, with a bunch of nostalgic sample choices that feel unironically appreciative instead of cynical in the way that a lot of vaporwave feels to me.

That may be the most ""mnnnnneeeehhh"" sentence I've ever written, but it's okay. :)",Spotiphonics,https://open.spotify.com/track/0CnpVWnvWxiWAxxCUqgsz1?si=ipmC4YwIQimFw0GX14uPZw
Lu,Amanda Palmer - Trout Heart Replica,"Without going into too many details, it's been a bloody hard week. When I get into certain emotional states, I find it's easiest to break through the feeling by doubling down on it, and listening to music that hits the same emotional space.

There are a few songs I could have picked, but ""Trout Heart Replica"" really gets at the bigger, macroscopic feelings in me right now. Palmer may be controversial, but she's gotten me through many dubious times in my life, so for good or for ill I'm all in for her. Her album <i>Theatre Is Evil</i> came when I was in a very dire part of my life, and I sunk my fingers into it so hard that even now I couldn't begin to unpack all the reasons I love this album. ""Trout Heart Replica"", at the time, was very sad but didn't resonate. But now?

""And killing things is not so hard it's hurting that's the hardest part
And when the wizard gets to me I'm asking for a smaller heart""

I'll be okay. But right now, feeling my feelings all the way is the important part.",Splort,https://open.spotify.com/track/0YWe2s8sbtkwVrL4OGMHZs?si=VzW5zbB1Sqej3SBuPZOakw
Proxy,Alice Glass - Without Love (Chelsea Wolfe Remix),"This song caused me to pose a question in SALSA at the end of the week on remixes, in particular on remixes that you enjoy more than the original song. The original ""Without Love"" is probably the most sonically-out-of-place track on Alice Glass' self-titled EP from 2017. With its more standard dark indie pop instrumental (complete with trap percussion), it was the track that made the least impact on me musically. Lyrically it's quite the powerful track in the narrative of Alice Glass though! Upon seeing this remix album, however, I got excited to see how this song got reinterpreted. My favourite of the bunch is remix album closer remixed by freak-folk/doom-metal auteur Chelsea Wolfe.

There is a lot to love here, but I'd like to focus in particular on the buildup. It starts off in a major key modulation of the song with some spacey and gentle instrumentation, adding brief bits of tension through any moments of dissonance and the gradual addition of more moving parts. It continues to build up this tension this way before cutting out and chopping up the vocal melody of the chorus with some moving bass synth, before exploding into a cacophany of intense noise. It's a payoff well worth the wait, and helps the lyrics (directed squarely at Cystal Castles shitheel Ethan Kath) land the impact they desire. It's an excellent remix, and from both an artistic and analytic perspective it's my preferred version by a landslide.",Without Spot,https://open.spotify.com/track/2u9OnnOovvQEXsrBKwtrei
