Lu,CupcakKe - Cartoons,"There is so much to love about CupcakKe, but what it really comes down to is her flow is fierce and her lyrics are so blunt they are an auditory punch. There are rhymed words in this song that I do not believe any other rapper ever has used, and that's saying something considering there are both so many emcees and so many kinds of rap out there. What CupcakKe has done time and time again is show how much you can be hard, tongue-and-cheek, and joyous, and sometimes all in the same song.",Spotify-Man Dick,https://open.spotify.com/track/2hOMwCEcW4lM0Ghm7W2Rgf
Proxy,tUnE-yArDs - ABC 123,"Political frustration is rarely as catchy as it is in the music of tUnE-yArDs, and ""ABC 123"" is no exception here. An ominously catchy opening sets the tone well, painting a natural scene of fury/punishment while also adding a grounding scenario that does not allow this all to get lost in the metaphorical. This intro perfectly describes the song in general, as well as the general appeal of tUnE-yArDs: direct political charge over infectious sing-songy hooks and drum loops, songs that are extremely straightforward and just as charged without losing their fun vibe. This has been stuck in my head since I first heard it over the holiday weekend, and makes me excited for the upcoming album this is a lead single of.",I can feel spotify crawl its way back into my private life,https://open.spotify.com/track/35rC7q0Z1Chr473tOEjE10
Makyo,REOL - 宵々古今,"What genre is this? We just don't know. It's j-pop, but gets a bit dubsteppy, but also there's a few sections in 12/8, but also there's some koto in there? I dunno! We found it a while back, but REOL came out with a new LP recently, so I've been going back through.","Spotify, but also sometimes in 12/8",https://open.spotify.com/track/3KLHSYHSmny4sJo2finqy9
Amdusias,Sorority Noise- No Halo,"*You're Not As ____ As You Think* is both a great album title and a great album, only slightly edged out in some of my year-end writings by The Menzingers' *After the Party*, but let's say that I really, really liked this whole Sorority Noise album.

""Earnest pop-punk"" is a genre that I'd love to hear more of; I love Mae to death, but I can only handle so many songs that amount to ""this relationship is awesome no actually it's bad."" So here we have a song that, from word of god, about what the singer's dead friend would have expected of him before dying. Not exactly a standard subject for the genre, but this song's catchy as hell to boot, so I enjoy it a lot.",Spotify but nothing is changed not even the spelling,https://open.spotify.com/track/6GsfeQjYT8J8i9xget9AjX
