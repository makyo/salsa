Found through my Discover weekly, [Hiatus Kaiyote](https://hiatuskaiyote.com/) is the postmodern-jukebox, electroswing-adjacent, multi-dimensional, polyrhythmic gangster shit you didn't know you needed!

Prowling through the album Tawk Tomahawk pulls up such gems as the bongo-centric "The World It Softly Lulls" and the forceful "Lace Skull". "Rainbow Rhodes" helps add some soothing ambiance after that. The opener, "Mobius Streak" is what got me hooked, though: swing-ish crooning above steady, rhythmic guitar and bass and plenty of brushed snare.

Heck yeah.
