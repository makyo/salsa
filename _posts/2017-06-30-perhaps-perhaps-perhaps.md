I got to thinking about Cake's covers. They've done a lot of really good ones --- their cover of I Will Survive is a delight --- but the one that's been on my mind is Perhaps, Perhaps, Perhaps.

It's one of those songs with a super long and interesting story. I was thinking that, when I wrote this, I would talk about this cover and the "original" Doris Day recording. It's more complicated than that, however. The original song --- *Quizás, Quizás, Quizás* --- was written back in 1947 by Osvaldo Farrés, and proceeded to drive several folks to fame. The english version of the lyrics was written a year later and isn't a direct translation, but also proved successful. The song was [covered in Arabic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJhQbe2Ycic) in 1954 by Fairuz.

The version I remember hearing first was [Doris Day's recording](https://open.spotify.com/track/1D2rNrzG4x1EfQHCSgiVB1), released in 1964. I can't remember where I heard it first, but it was some time in high school. I made our choir retrospective video at the end of my senior year and used it in there.

The Cake version is very...well, Cake. It was one of a series of covers they made (including the ridiculous and fantastic [I Will Survive](https://open.spotify.com/track/0qgiFuYhYuwtFXEwYakddE)), showing up on their 1996 album Fashion Nugget. The drums are comfortably loose without being sloppy. The brass is spot on. The bass, one of the band's strengths, is a solid foundation. McCrea's vocals are delightfully McCrea. He sings very forward, not always on key, and always sounds a bit confused.

All that aside, this was my pick because it got stuck in my head on the flight back from London and hasn't left, nothing more `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`
