As you might've seen going around, Bandcamp is donating all of their proceeds from music sales today to the Transgender Law Center! There's quite a few trans, genderqueer, genderful, and genderless folks within SALSA, so we recommend going and checking that out! Additionally, some of us also have stuff of our own on Bandcamp!

* [Fuzzy Proxy](https://fuzzyproxy.bandcamp.com/)
* [Out and Loud Records](http://outandloudrecords.bandcamp.com)
* [Dan Veytia](http://music.danveytia.com/) (including a mix by Amdusias!)

There's doubtless more, too! As we get the links, we'll keep this post updated. Plus, even after 8/4, do check these out! Lots of good musicky fuzzies here :3
