Why would a Telegram group have a web page?

Makyo is addicted to domain names, that's why.

Also, so we can blog! S.A.L.S.A. has been going for a while now, and we all have some good thoughts on music --- stuff we like, stuff we don't, etc. --- and this would be a good place to put them so that we can share.

This site is run on Jekyll and hosted on GitHub. If you've done that sort of thing before, cool: file a PR as normal. If not, though, there are a few ways to get an article up:

1. File an issue with the article contents [here](https://github.com/makyo/salsa/issues). It can be just text, or you can do rich text with [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown). Or you can just write the text and describe what you want. Whatever. It's all good.
2. Email Makyo with an article. Same goes as above. Email to `makyo+salsa@drab-makyo.com`.
3. Drop it in the telegram chat. Same goes as above.

Not on the telegram chat? Just drop one of us a line, or email Makyo as above!
