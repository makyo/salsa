title: Animals as Leaders' Meedly Acoustics

Oh god just fuck me up with jittery acoustic (or at least clean electric) guitars. Seriously.

I don't even remember how I found [AaL](http://www.animalsasleaders.org/), either through Discover or *SALSA*, but dang. Like, I dig a lot of their stuff. They can get kinda chuggy and speedy on the metal side, and I totally dig that. But what really hooked me is the bouncy, jittery, ecstatic guitar meedling.

Meedling/meedly is hard to describe, but, as an onomatopoeia, it's pretty readily understandable.
