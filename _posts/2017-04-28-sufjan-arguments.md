title: Sufjan Stevens Will Tear Us Apart
author: Makyo

For some reason, two weeks or so ago, *SALSA* just started arguing about Sufjan Stevens. Like, there was a lot of very loud agreement, and then a lot of very loud disagreement. Stickers were abused. It was fun. Anyway, figured I'd get a bunch of thoughts on him. Maybe others will write stuff, too, since he inspires so much hollering.

I pulled together a list of stuff I liked:

I also really like [The BQE](https://open.spotify.com/album/0uckcHnIdodDv7qO0brWLY), but I wasn't sure whether or not I wanted to dump it in that list.

I dunno. Stevens is kinda hit-or-miss for me. Or maybe excellent-or-meh. None of his stuff strikes me as particularly bad, none of it really inspires revulsion, but some of it bores the heck out of me. The bits that I like, though, I *really* like.

Because of that, I think I get why some people hate his music, or at least don't get why others like it, and why that feels divisive. I really wasn't a fan of [Carrie and Lowell](https://open.spotify.com/album/0U8DeqqKDgIhIiWOdqiQXE) but I know it struck a lot of nerves for folks and engaged their Feels Enginesâ„¢.

Another really divisive group I dig is [Danielson](https://open.spotify.com/artist/5XvxZQicSAiQtsXZ4lXWDo). Like, *super* divisive. A lot of people I know *hate* their music, but a lot pings on my "awesomely weird" radar.

At the same time, I don't get St. Vincent. I can see why folks like her, but it just doesn't work for me. I thought [Love This Giant](https://open.spotify.com/album/4oRaFi044yhwH77gUXbH5I) was pretty good, but mostly because I have a crush on David Byrne. I've dutifully listened to her other albums, but nothing stuck.

I guess music's just one big ![shrug](/assets/posts/floe--shruggle--makyo.png)

Maybe other *SALSA*-zens have thoughts?
