## Proxy: [*Igorrr --- Houmous*](https://open.spotify.com/track/0Zy1tSVAQ8pIugxsEbeAar)

So, this recent Igorrr album is the first album of theirs I listened to the very moment I could after release.  I've always digged their aesthetic, and the technical complexity is very much on display here, along with checking off a lot of my personal pleasure points: complex rhythms, breakcore drums, digitally-manipulated screaming, operatic vocals, neat chords.  Why Houmous has seen more play for me even after just having finished the first pass of the album before writing this is the marriage of the metal and breakcore elements with accordion and sax lines that give it a more folksy feeling (grounding it in a way akin to Venetian Snares' Rossz Csillag Alatt Sz√ºletett) before going completely off the rails.  If that wasn't enough, either, it has a chiptune ending section that reprises the accordion part!  It's like this song was made for me!  Heck, I'm happy that Houmous exists and that Savage Sinusoid was as great of an album as it was.

## Alteq: [*Aesop Rock --- Shrunk*](https://open.spotify.com/track/1Wve83RcS2IGmWyCYSGVqr)

Well, 'The Impossible Kid' has been in my rotation for almost a year now. This album is so solid and I really enjoy the personal perspective Aes brings so the table on this record. Whether it's amusing anecdotes about his brother's, watching his kitten, or in this case dealing with the balance of going to a shrink, there's a nice blend of musicality and raw honesty. 'Shrunk' stands out to me in particular for a few reasons. One, I enjoy how Aes makes a mock dialog in the third verse.. It really sells the back and forth that her going for not just with his doctor but with himself. Two, I enjoy how his skepticism leaks through in the progression of the song, which he is able to ultimately overcome. Nice track, great album.

## Makyo: [*Aaron Copland --- Dance Symphony, Mvt III*](https://open.spotify.com/track/2sIs8tB6tlg1bS1T04x6mG)

Never forget that Aaron Copland wrote a symphony based off a ballet about vampires that includes American folk tunes. Never.

The third movement in particular is jarring and dissonant and uneven and all around wonderful~

To be honest, I was going to go with Proxy's pick, but purplecat beat me to it, and I already [wrote about it](/2017/06/16/savage-sinusoid/) Go listen to that, too ^^

## Lu: [*Lorde --- The Louvre*](https://open.spotify.com/track/5q4BpnMrYEFzLO0dYODj6J)

"To quote Proxy about Lorde's new album Melodrama: ""Y'know the sophomore slump? Yeah Lorde has taken that idea and fucking tossed it into the incinerator.""

Melodrama is a witheringly good album. It is equal parts melancholy, celebratory, and pensive, and they all work to create a cohesive cycle of songs about love, loss, and rededication to personal triumph. If I could choose the entire album for the Weekly, I would, but I cannot. So I am choosing this song, ""The Lourve"", which is a soft godray of light that breathes a warm glow into the first half of Melodrama. Lorde gets a little humour in, too--""down the back, but who cares, still the Lourve""--and it just pops. This whole song just sits like fresh laundry on my skin, properly warm and properly clean."

## Lorxus: [*The Album Leaf Broken Arrow*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UkKcEia0-N8)

By now the worst of the storm's died down, though it's still pouring rain. What do you care? There's no end of exploration to go do, and no end of memory to reminisce over.
